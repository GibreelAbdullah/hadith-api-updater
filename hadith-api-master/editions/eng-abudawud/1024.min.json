When he is sure about the completion of his prayer, he should make two prostrations (at the end of the prayer). If the prayer is complete, the additional rak’ah and the two prostrations will be supererogatory prayer. If the prayer is incomplete, the additional rak’ahs will compensate it, and the two prostrations will be a disgrace for the devil","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (571)"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":635},"chapter":{"id":199,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا شَكَّ فِي الثِّنْتَيْنِ وَالثَّلاَثِ مَنْ قَالَ يُلْقِي الشَّكَّ","eng-name":"Whoever Said The Doubt Should Be Ignored When One Is Confused Regarding (Whether He Has Prayed) Two Or Three Rak'ah","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
