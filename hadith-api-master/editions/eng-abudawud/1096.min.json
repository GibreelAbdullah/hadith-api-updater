He was called al-Hakam ibn Hazn al-Kulafi. He began to narrate a tradition to us saying: I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a delegation consisting of seven or nine persons. We entered upon him and said: Messenger of Allah, we have visited you, so pray Allah what is good for us. He ordered to give us some dates. The Muslims in those days were weak. We stayed there for several days and offered the Friday prayer along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He stood leaning on a staff or a bow. He praised Allah and exalted Him in light, pure and blessed words. Then he said: O people, you have no power to obey or you cannot obey what you are ordered. But be straight and give good tidings. Abu 'Ali said: Did you hear Abu Dawud ?
