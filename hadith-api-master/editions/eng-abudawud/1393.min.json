The signatories of the pact came to al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah as his guests. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made Banu-Malik stay in a tent of his. Musaddad's version says: He was in the deputation of Thaqif which came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He used to visit and have a talk with us every day after the night prayer. The version of AbuSa'id says: He remained standing for such a long time (talking to us) that he put his weight sometimes on one leg and sometimes on the other due to his long stay. He mostly told us how his people, the Quraysh, behaved with him. He would say: We were not equal; we were weak and degraded at Mecca (according to Musaddad's version). When we came over to Medina the fighting began between us; sometimes we overcome them and at other times they overcome us. One night he came late and did not come at the time he used to come. We asked him: You came late tonight? He said: I could not recite the fixed part of the Qur'an that I used to recite every day. I disliked to come till I had completed it. Aws said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): How do you divide the Qur'an for daily recitation? They said: Three surahs, five surahs, eleven surahs, thirteen surahs' mufassal surahs.
