But you or any of your companions should not eat out of it. Abu Dawud said: The following words of this tradition are not supported by any other tradition “You should not eat of it yourself nor any of your companions”. The version of `Abdal Warith has the words “then hang it in its neck” instead of the words “mark or strike with it”.
