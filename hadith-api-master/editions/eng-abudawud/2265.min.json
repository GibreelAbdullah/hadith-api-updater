If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he was not joined to the heirs and did not inherit even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":91},"chapter":{"id":30,"ara-name":"باب فِي ادِّعَاءِ وَلَدِ الزِّنَا","eng-name":"Claiming An Illegitimate Son","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
