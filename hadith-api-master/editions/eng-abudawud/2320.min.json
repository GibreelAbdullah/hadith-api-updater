If the weather is cloudy, calculate it thirty days. When the twenty-ninth of Sha’ban came, Ibn ‘Umar would send someone (who tried) to sight the moon for him. If it was sighted then well and good, in case it was not sighted and there was no cloud and dust before him (on the horizon) he would not keep fast the next day. If there appeared (on the horizon) before him cloud or dust, he would fast the following day. Ibn ‘Umar would end his fasting alone with the people and did not follow this calculation.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (1080)"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":8},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب الشَّهْرِ يَكُونُ تِسْعًا وَعِشْرِينَ","eng-name":"The Month May Be Twenty-Nine Days","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
