He said: I came to syria and performed her work. The moon of Ramadan appeared while I was in Syria. We sighted the moon on the night of Friday. When I came to Median towards the end of the month (of Ramadan), Ibn 'Abbas asked me about the moon. He said: When did you sight the moon ? I said: I sighted it on the night of Friday. He asked: Did you sight it yourself ? I said: Yes, and the people sighted it. They fasted and Mu'awiyah also fasted. He said: But we sighted it on the night of saturday. Since then we have been fasting until we complete thirty days or we sight it. Then I said: Are the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiyah and his fasts not sufficient for us? He replied: No. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to do so","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim (1087)"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":20},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا رُؤِيَ الْهِلاَلُ فِي بَلَدٍ قَبْلَ الآخَرِينَ بِلَيْلَةٍ","eng-name":"When The Crescent Is Sighted In A Land A Night Before It Is Sighted In Other Lands","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
