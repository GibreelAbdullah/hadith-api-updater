The place for easing dearer to the Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ) was a mound or host of palm trees by which he could conceal himself. He entered the garden of a man from the Ansar(Helpers). All of a sudden when a Camel saw the Prophet (ﷺ) it wept tenderly producing yearning sound and it eyes flowed. The Prophet (ﷺ) came to it and wiped the temple of its head. So it kept silence. He then said “Who is the master of this Camel? Whose Camel is this? A young man from the Ansar came and said “This is mine, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ).” He said “Don’t you fear Allaah about this beast which Allaah has given in your possession. It has complained to me that you keep it hungry and load it heavily which fatigues it.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih Sahih Muslim (342 Mukhtasar)"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":73},"chapter":{"id":47,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُؤْمَرُ بِهِ مِنَ الْقِيَامِ عَلَى الدَّوَابِّ وَالْبَهَائِمِ","eng-name":"What Has Been Commanded Regarding Proper Care For Riding Beasts And Cattle","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
