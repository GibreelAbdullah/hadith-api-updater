He found a well and e went down in it. He drank water and came out. Suddenly he saw a dog panting and eating soil due to thirst. The man said (to himself) “This dog must have reached the same condition due to thirst as I had reached. So he went down into the well, filled his sock with water, held it with his mouth and came up. He supplied water to the dog. Allaah appreciated this and forgave him.” They asked “Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ), Is there any reward for us for these beasts? He replied, For every cool liver there is a reward.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (2363) Sahih Muslim (2244)"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":74},"chapter":{"id":47,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُؤْمَرُ بِهِ مِنَ الْقِيَامِ عَلَى الدَّوَابِّ وَالْبَهَائِمِ","eng-name":"What Has Been Commanded Regarding Proper Care For Riding Beasts And Cattle","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
