When Allah's name is mentioned you may eat what is killed by anything which causes the blood to flow except tooth and claw. I shall tell you about it. The tooth is a bone, and the claw is the knife of Abyssinians.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) passed by over the cooking pots. He ordered to turn them over. He then divided (the spoils of war) between them, and gave them a camel for ten goats in equation. One of the camels of the people ran away, and they had no horses with them at that time. A man shot an arrow at it, and Allah prevented it from escaping. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Among animals (i.e. camels) there are some which bolt like wild animals ; so when any of them does so, do with it like this","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (5498) Sahih Muslim (1968)"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":15,"ara-name":"باب فِي الذَّبِيحَةِ بِالْمَرْوَةِ","eng-name":"Slaughtering With Marwah","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
