Shurahbil al-Awadi:A man came to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and Salman b. Rabi'ah, and asked about a case where there were a daughter, a son's daughter and full sister.

So the man came to him and informed him about their opinion. He said: I would then be in error and not be one of those who are rightly guided. But I decide concerning the matter as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did: The daughter gets half, and the son's daughter gets a share which complete thirds (i.e. gets a sixth), and what remain to the full sister","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (6736)"}],"reference":{"book":19,"hadith":6},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي مِيرَاثِ الصُّلْبِ","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About The Inheritance For Descendants","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
