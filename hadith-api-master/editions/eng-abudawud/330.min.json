'Umar, I went to Ibn 'Abbas for a certain work. He (Ibn 'Abbas) narrated a tradition saying: A man passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in a street, while he returned from the toilet or just urinated. He (the man) saluted him, but the Prophet did not return the salutation. When the man was about to disappear (from sight) in the street he struck the wall with both his hands and wiped his face with them. He then struck another stroke and wipes his arms. He then returned the man's salutation. Then he said: I did not return the salutation to you because I was not purified. Abu Dawud said: I heard Ahmad b. Hanbal say: Muhammad b. Thabit reported a rejected tradition. Ibn Dasah said: Abu Dawud said: No one supported Muhammad b. Thabit in respect of narrating this tradition as to striking the wall twice (for wiping) from the Prophet (ﷺ), but reported it as an action of Ibn 'Umar","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":330},"chapter":{"id":125,"ara-name":"باب التَّيَمُّمِ فِي الْحَضَرِ","eng-name":"Tayammum During Residency","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
