'Umar: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If any of you can become like the man who had a faraq of rice, he should become like him. They (the people) asked: Who is the man who had a faraq of rice with him, Messenger of Allah ? Thereupon he narrated the story of the cave when a hillock fell on them (three persons), each of them said: Mention any best work of yours. The narrator said: The third of them said: O Allah, you know that I took a hireling for a faraq of rice. When the evening came, I presented to him his due (i.e. his wages). But he refused to take it and went away. I then cultivated it until I amassed cows and their herdsmen for him. He then met me and said: Give me my dues. I said (to him): Go to those cows and their herdsmen and take them all. He went and drove them away","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Munkar"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Munkar"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":62},"chapter":{"id":29,"ara-name":"باب فِي الرَّجُلِ يَتَّجِرُ فِي مَالِ الرَّجُلِ بِغَيْرِ إِذْنِهِ","eng-name":"Regarding A Man Who Does Trade With Another Man's Wealth Without His Permission","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
