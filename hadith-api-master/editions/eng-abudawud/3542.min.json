Bashir: My father gave me a gift. The narrator Isma'il b. Salim said: (He gave me) his slave as a gift. My mother 'Umrah daughter of Rawahah said: Go to the Messenger of Allah and call him as witness. He then came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned it to him. He said him: I have given my son al-Nu'man a gift, and 'Umrah has asked me to call you as witness to it. He asked him: Have you children other than him? He said: I replied: Yes. He again asked: Have you given the rest of them the same as you have given al-Nu'man ? He said: No. Some of these narrators said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This in injustice. The others said in their version (that the Prophet said:) This is under force. So call some other person than me as witness to it. Mughirah said in his version: (The Prophet asked): Are you not pleased with the fact that all of them may be equal in virtue and grace ? He replied: Yes. He said: Then call some other person than me as witness to it.
