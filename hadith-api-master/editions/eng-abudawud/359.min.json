A woman from the Quraysh asked her about praying with the clothes which a woman wore while she menstruated. Umm Salamah said: We would menstruate in the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then each one of us refrained (from prayer) during menstrual period. When she was purified, she would look at the clothe in which she menstruated. If it were smeared with blood, we would wash it and pray with it; if there were nothing in it, we would leave it and that would not prevent us from praying with it (the same clothe). As regards the woman who had plaited hair - sometimes each of us had plaited hair - when she washed, she would not undo the hair. She would instead pour three handfuls of water upon her head. When she felt moisture in the roots of her hair, she would rub them. Then she would pour water upon her whole body","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":359},"chapter":{"id":133,"ara-name":"باب الْمَرْأَةِ تَغْسِلُ ثَوْبَهَا الَّذِي تَلْبَسُهُ فِي حَيْضِهَا","eng-name":"A Woman Washes Her Garment That She Wears During Her Menses [To Pray In]","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
