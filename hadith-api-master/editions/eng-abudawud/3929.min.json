'Aishah said to her:Return to your people ; if you like that I make payment for the purchase of your freedom on your behalf and I shall have the right to inherit from you, I shall do so. Barirah mentioned it to her people, but they refused and said: If she wants to purchase your freedom for reward from Allah, she may do so, but the right to inherit from her shall be ours. She mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Purchase her (freedom) and set her free, for the right of inheritance belongs to only to the one who set a person free. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then stood up and said: If anyone makes a condition which is not in Allah's Book, he has no right to it, even if he stipulates it hundred times. Allah's condition is more valid and binding","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari (2661، 2717) Sahih Muslim (1504)"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":4},"chapter":{"id":2,"ara-name":"باب فِي بَيْعِ الْمُكَاتَبِ إِذَا فُسِخَتِ الْكِتَابَةُ","eng-name":"Selling A Mukathib If His Contract Of Manumission Is Annulled","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
