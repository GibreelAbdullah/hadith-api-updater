I took some mules from it. When I entered the mosque (of Kufah), I found there some people of moderate stature, and among them was a man whom you could recognize when you saw him that he was from the people of Hijaz. I asked: Who is he? The people frowned at me and said: Do you not recognize him? This is Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, the companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Then Hudhayfah said: People used to ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about good, and I used to ask him about evil. Then the people stared hard at him. He said: I know the reason why you dislike it. I then asked: Messenger of Allah, will there be evil as there was before, after this good which Allah has bestowed on us? He replied: Yes. I asked: Wherein does the protection from it lie? He replied: In the sword. I asked: Messenger of Allah, what will then happen? He replied: If Allah has on Earth a caliph who flays your back and takes your property, obey him, otherwise die holding onto the stump of a tree. I asked: What will come next? He replied: Then the Antichrist (Dajjal) will come forth accompanied by a river and fire. He who falls into his fire will certainly receive his reward, and have his load taken off him, but he who falls into his river will have his load retained and his reward taken off him. I then asked: What will come next? He said: The Last Hour will come","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":5},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب ذِكْرِ الْفِتَنِ وَدَلاَئِلِهَا","eng-name":"Mention Of Tribulations And Their Signs","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
