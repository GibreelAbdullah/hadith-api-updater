Ibn Mas'ud said: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: He then mentioned a portion of the tradition narrated by AbuBakrah (No. 4243). This version adds: He (the Prophet) said: All their slain will go to Hell. I (Wabisah) asked: When will this happen Ibn Mas'ud? He replied: This is the period of turmoil (harj) when a man will not be safe from his associates. I asked: What do you command me (to do) if I happen to live during that period? He replied: You should restrain your tongue and hand and stay at home. When Uthman was slain, I recollected this tradition. I then rode (on a camel) and came to Damascus. There I met Khuraym ibn Fatik and mentioned this tradition to him. He swore by Allah, there was no god but He, he had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), as Ibn Mas'ud transmitted it to me (Wabisah)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif Isnaad"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":19},"chapter":{"id":2,"ara-name":"باب فِي النَّهْىِ عَنِ السَّعْىِ، فِي الْفِتْنَةِ","eng-name":"The Prohibition Of Participating In The Tribulation","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
