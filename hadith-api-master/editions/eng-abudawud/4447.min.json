Azib said:The people passed by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with a jew whose face blackened with charcoal and he was being taken around.

But fornication spread among our people of rank, so we disliked that a person of rank should be left alone and the punishment be inflicted on one who is lower in rank than him. So we suspended it for us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then commanded regarding him and he was stoned to death. He then said: O Allah!
