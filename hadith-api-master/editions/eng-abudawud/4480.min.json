Humran and another man bore witness against him (for drinking wine). One of them testified that he had seen him drinking wine, and the other testified that he had seen him vomiting it. Uthman said: He could not vomit it, unless he did not drink it. He said to Ali: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him. Ali said to al-Hasan: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him. Al-Hasan said: He who has enjoyed its pleasure should also bear its burden. So Ali said to Abdullah ibn Ja'far: Inflict the prescribed punishment on him. He took a whip and struck him with it while Ali was counting. When he reached (struck) forty (lashes), he said: It is sufficient. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave forty lashes. I think he also said: \"And AbuBakr gave forty lashes, and Uthman eighty. This is all sunnah (standard practice).
