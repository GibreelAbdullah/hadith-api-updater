The word of Allah, Most High, reads: \"O ye who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess, and the (children) among you, who have not come of age, ask your permission (before) they enter your presence on three occasions: before morning prayer, while you are undressing for the noonday heat, and after late-night prayer. These are your three times of undress; outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about.\" Al-Qa'nabi recited the verse up to \"full of knowledge and wisdom\". Ibn Abbas said: Allah is Most Clement and Most Merciful to the believers. He loves concealment. The people had neither curtains nor curtained canopies in their houses. Sometimes a servant, a child or a female orphan of a man entered while the man was having sexual intercourse with his wife. So Allah commanded them to ask permission in those times of undress. Then Allah brought them curtains and all good things. But I did not see anyone following it after that. Abu Dawud said: The tradition of 'Ubaid Allah and of 'Ata, weakens this tradition","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Hasan Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":420},"chapter":{"id":142,"ara-name":"باب الاِسْتِئْذَانِ فِي الْعَوْرَاتِ الثَّلاَثِ","eng-name":"Asking permission to enter at the three times of undress","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
