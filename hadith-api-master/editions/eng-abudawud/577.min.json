I sat down and did not pray along with them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) turned towards us and saw that Yazid was sitting there. He said: Did you not embrace Islam, Yazid? He replied: Why not, Messenger of Allah; I have embraced Islam. He said: What prevented you from saying prayer along with the people? He replied: I have already prayed in my house, and I thought that you had prayed (in congregation). He said: When you come to pray (in the mosque) and find the people praying, then you should pray along with them, though you have already prayed. This will be a supererogatory prayer for you and that will be counted as obligatory","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":187},"chapter":{"id":57,"ara-name":"باب فِيمَنْ صَلَّى فِي مَنْزِلِهِ ثُمَّ أَدْرَكَ الْجَمَاعَةَ يُصَلِّي مَعَهُمْ","eng-name":"The One Who Prays In His House, Then Catches The Congregation, He Should Pray With Them","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
