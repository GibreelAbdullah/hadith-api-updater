It had fringes which I turned over and crossed the two ends, and bowed down retaining it with my neck lest it should fall down. Then I came and stood on the left side of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He then took and brought me around him and set me on his right side. Then Ibn Sakhr came and stood on his left side. he then took us with his both hands and made us stand behind him.

When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished the prayer, he said (to me): O Jabir. I said; Yes, Messenger of Allah.
