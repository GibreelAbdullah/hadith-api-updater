One of the things that I was taught was that it was that it was pointed out me. When you sneeze, praise Allah (I,e, say “praise be to Allah”); and when someone sneezes and praises Allah, say “ May Allah have mercy on you. Meanwhile I was standing along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) during prayer, all of a sudden a man sneezed, and he praised Allah. So I said, “may Allah have mercy on you”, in a loud voice. The people gave me disapproving looks so much so that I took ill of it. So I said :what do you mean by looking at me with furtive glances. Then they glorified Allah. When the prophet (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he asked; who was the speaker? The Prophet told him; this Bedouin. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called me and said to me: Prayer is meant for the recitation of the Quran, and making mention of Allah. When you are in it (prayer), this should be your work therein. I never saw an instructor more lenient than the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Muhyi Al-Din Abdul Hamid","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":542},"chapter":{"id":173,"ara-name":"باب تَشْمِيتِ الْعَاطِسِ فِي الصَّلاَةِ","eng-name":"Responding To The One Who Has Sneezed In The Prayer","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
