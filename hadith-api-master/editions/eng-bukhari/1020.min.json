You came to order people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah.' So the Prophet (ﷺ) recited the Holy verses of Surat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura \"Ad- Dukhan\"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the battle of Badr.\" Asbat added on the authority of Mansur, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":15},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا اسْتَشْفَعَ الْمُشْرِكُونَ بِالْمُسْلِمِينَ عِنْدَ الْقَحْطِ","eng-name":"If Al-Mushrikun intercede the Muslim to invoke Allah for rain during drought","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
