While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The livestock are dying and the families (offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless us with rain.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. Then the clouds started gathering like mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw rainwater trickling down his beard. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday, when the same Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! The houses have collapsed and the livestock are drowned. Please invoke Allah for us.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) raised both his hands and said, \"O Allah! Around us and not on us.\" Whichever side the Prophet (ﷺ) directed his hand, the clouds dispersed from there till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley of Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who didn't talk about the abundant rain","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":28},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ تَمَطَّرَ فِي الْمَطَرِ حَتَّى يَتَحَادَرَ عَلَى لِحْيَتِهِ","eng-name":"One who stood in the rain till the water started trickling down his beard","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
