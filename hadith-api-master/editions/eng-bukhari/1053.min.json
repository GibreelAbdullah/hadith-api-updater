I said, 'Is there a sign?' She pointed out in the affirmative.\" Asma' further said, \"I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Allah and said, 'I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma' said.)
