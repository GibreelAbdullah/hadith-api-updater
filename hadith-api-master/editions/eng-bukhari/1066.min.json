When he stood straight from bowing he would say \"Sami 'allahu liman hamidah Rabbana wa laka l-hamd.\" And he would again start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two rak`at. Al-Auza'i and others said that they had heard Az-Zuhri from 'Urwa from `Aisha saying, \"In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 'Prayer in congregation.' He led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two rak`at.\" Narrated Al-Walid that `Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhri said, \"I asked ('Urwa), 'What did your brother `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair do? He prayed two rak`at (of the eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Medina.' 'Urwa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet's tradition.\" Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be offered with loud recitation","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":24},"chapter":{"id":19,"ara-name":"باب الْجَهْرِ بِالْقِرَاءَةِ فِي الْكُسُوفِ","eng-name":"To recite aloud in the eclipse Salat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
