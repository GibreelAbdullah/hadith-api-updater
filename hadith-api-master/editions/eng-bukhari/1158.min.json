I also saw as if two persons (i.e. angels) came to me and wanted to take me to Hell. Then an angel met us and told me not to be afraid. He then told them to leave me. Hafsa narrated one of my dreams to the Prophet (ﷺ) and the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Abdullah is a good man. Would that he offer the night prayer (Tahajjud)!\" So after that day `Abdullah (bin `Umar) started offering Tahajjud. The companions of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to tell him their dreams that (Laila-tul-Qadr) was on the 27th of the month of Ramadan. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I see that your dreams agree on the last ten nights of Ramadan and so whoever is in search of it should seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":19,"hadith":37},"chapter":{"id":21,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ تَعَارَّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَصَلَّى","eng-name":"The superiority of one who wakes up at night and offers the Salat with a loud voice","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
