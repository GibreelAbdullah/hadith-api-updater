The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the `Isha' prayer (in the mosque), returned home and after having prayed four rak`at, he slept. Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five rak`at followed by two more rak`at. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":59},"chapter":{"id":41,"ara-name":"باب السَّمَرِ بِالْعِلْمِ","eng-name":"To speak about (religious) knowledge at night","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
