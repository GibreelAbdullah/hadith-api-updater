Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) heard it and said:--\"Say, 'at-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu 'Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu warahmatu- l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-'ala 'ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `Abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worshipper of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":6},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ سَمَّى قَوْمًا أَوْ سَلَّمَ فِي الصَّلاَةِ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ مُوَاجَهَةً وَهُوَ لاَ يَعْلَمُ","eng-name":"Whoever named some people or greeted somebody during As-Salat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
