Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":9},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ رَجَعَ الْقَهْقَرَى فِي صَلاَتِهِ، أَوْ تَقَدَّمَ بِأَمْرٍ يَنْزِلُ بِهِ","eng-name":"Whoever came back or went forward during the Salat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
