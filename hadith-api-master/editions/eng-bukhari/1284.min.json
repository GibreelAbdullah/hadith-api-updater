The Prophet (ﷺ) got up, and so did Sa`d bin 'Ubada, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka`b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The child was brought to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (ﷺ) started shedding tears. Sa`d said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is this?\" He replied, \"It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":44},"chapter":{"id":32,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم: «يُعَذَّبُ الْمَيِّتُ بِبَعْضِ بُكَاءِ أَهْلِهِ عَلَيْهِ» إِذَا كَانَ النَّوْحُ مِنْ سُنَّتِهِ","eng-name":"The statement of the Prophet (ﷺ) ﷺ : \"The deceased is punished because of the weeping (with wailing) of some of his relatives, if wailing was the custom of that dead person.\"","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
