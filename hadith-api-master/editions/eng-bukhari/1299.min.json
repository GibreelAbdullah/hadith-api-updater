A man came and told him about the crying of the women of Ja`far. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered him to forbid them. The man went and came back saying that he had told them but they did not listen to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Forbid them.\" So again he went and came back for the third time and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, they did not listen to us at all.\" (`Aisha added): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered him to go and put dust in their mouths.
