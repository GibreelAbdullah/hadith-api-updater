The angel went back to his Lord, and said, \"You sent me to a slave who does not want to die.\" Allah restored his eye and said, \"Go back and tell him (i.e. Moses) to place his hand over the back of an ox, for he will be allowed to live for a number of years equal to the number of hairs coming under his hand.\" (So the angel came to him and told him the same). Then Moses asked, \"O my Lord! What will be then?\" He said, \"Death will be then.\" He said, \"(Let it be) now.\" He asked Allah that He bring him near the Sacred Land at a distance of a stone's throw.
