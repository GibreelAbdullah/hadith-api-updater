He ordered (that he be taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the Prophet's) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). `Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear. Abu Harun said, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at that time had two shirts and the son of `Abdullah bin Ubai said to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Clothe my father in your shirt which has been in contact with your skin.' ' Sufyan added, \"Thus people think that the Prophet (ﷺ) clothed `Abdullah bin Tubal in his shirt in lieu of what he (Abdullah) had done (for Al `Abbas, the Prophet's uncle)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":104},"chapter":{"id":77,"ara-name":"باب هَلْ يُخْرَجُ الْمَيِّتُ مِنَ الْقَبْرِ وَاللَّحْدِ لِعِلَّةٍ","eng-name":"Can the dead body be taken out of its grave","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
