The Prophet (ﷺ) came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, \"There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched.\" A man said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?\" The Prophet said, \"The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.\" Then he recited the Verses:-- \"As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":115},"chapter":{"id":82,"ara-name":"باب مَوْعِظَةِ الْمُحَدِّثِ عِنْدَ الْقَبْرِ، وَقُعُودِ أَصْحَابِهِ حَوْلَهُ","eng-name":"Preacher delivering a lecture at a grave and the sitting of his com anions around him","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
