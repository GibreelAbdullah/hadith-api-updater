She replied, 'In three Suhuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":139},"chapter":{"id":94,"ara-name":"باب مَوْتِ يَوْمِ الاِثْنَيْنِ","eng-name":"Dying on Monday","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
