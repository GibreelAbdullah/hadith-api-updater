(9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed regarding the people of the scriptures.\" I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the scriptures.\" So we had a quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a complaint against me to `Uthman. `Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to `Uthman who said to me, \"You may depart and live nearby if you wish.\" That was the reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":11},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب مَا أُدِّيَ زَكَاتُهُ فَلَيْسَ بِكَنْزٍ","eng-name":"A property from which the Zakat is paid is not Al-Kanz (hoarded-money)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
