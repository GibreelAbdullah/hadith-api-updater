So, when you reach there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best of their possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because there is no screen between his invocation and Allah","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":96},"chapter":{"id":63,"ara-name":"باب أَخْذِ الصَّدَقَةِ مِنَ الأَغْنِيَاءِ وَتُرَدَّ فِي الْفُقَرَاءِ حَيْثُ كَانُوا","eng-name":"Zakat should be taken from the rich and given to the poor","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
