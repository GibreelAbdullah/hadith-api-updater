He said, \"Isn't it the Day of Nahr?\" We said, \"It is.\" He further asked, \"Which month is this?\" We said, \"Allah and His Apostle know better.\" He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name.

It is.\" He further asked, \"What town is this?\" We replied, \"Allah and His Apostle know it better.\" He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name.
