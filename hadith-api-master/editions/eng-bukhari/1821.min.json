At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), \"I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet (ﷺ) so I went in search of the Prophet (ﷺ) and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, \"Where did you leave the Prophet (ﷺ) ?\" He replied, \"I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet (ﷺ) and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah's Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me.
