We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . The man replied that he had left the Prophet (ﷺ) at a place called Ta'hin and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till I reached him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah's Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.\" So he did. Then I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":28,"hadith":2},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا رَأَى الْمُحْرِمُونَ صَيْدًا فَضَحِكُوا فَفَطِنَ الْحَلاَلُ","eng-name":"If the Muhrimun saw game and laughed and a non-Muhrim understood, they are allowed to eat the game","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
