Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. There are two pleasures for the fasting person, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his Lord; then he will be pleased because of his fasting","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":30,"hadith":14},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب هَلْ يَقُولُ إِنِّي صَائِمٌ إِذَا شُتِمَ","eng-name":"Should one say, \"I am observing Saum (fast)\" on being abused?","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
