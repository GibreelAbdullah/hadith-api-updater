In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet (ﷺ) came and addressed us and said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in I`tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":3},"chapter":{"id":2,"ara-name":"باب الْتِمَاسِ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ فِي السَّبْعِ الأَوَاخِرِ","eng-name":"To look for the night of Qadr in the last seven nights (of Ramadan)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
