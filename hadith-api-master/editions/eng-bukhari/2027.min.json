The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever was in I`tikaf with me should stay in I`tikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.\" It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms.
