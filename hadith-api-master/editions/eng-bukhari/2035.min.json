She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet (ﷺ) accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, \"She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.\" Both of them said, \"Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), \"Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one's body).
