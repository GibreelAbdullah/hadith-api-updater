So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in I`tikaf with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) should return for it.' The people returned to the mosque (for I`tikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":11},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب الاِعْتِكَافِ وَخَرَجَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم صَبِيحَةَ عِشْرِينَ","eng-name":"Coming out of I'tikaf in the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
