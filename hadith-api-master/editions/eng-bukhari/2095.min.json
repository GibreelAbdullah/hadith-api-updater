Shall I make something for you to sit on, as I have a slave who is a carpenter?\" He replied, \"If you wish.\" So, she got a pulpit made for him. When it was Friday the Prophet (ﷺ) sat on that pulpit. The date-palm stem near which the Prophet (ﷺ) used to deliver his sermons cried so much so that it was about to burst. The Prophet (ﷺ) came down from the pulpit to the stem and embraced it and it started groaning like a child being persuaded to stop crying and then it stopped crying. The Prophet (ﷺ) said,\"It has cried because of (missing) what it use to hear of the religions knowledge","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":48},"chapter":{"id":32,"ara-name":"باب النَّجَّارِ","eng-name":"The carpenter","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
