Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) selected her for himself and he set out in her company till he reached Sadd-ar-Rawha' where her menses were over and he married her. Then Hais (a kind of meal) was prepared and served on a small leather sheet (used for serving meals). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said to me, \"Inform those who are around you (about the wedding banquet).\" So that was the marriage banquet given by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) for (his marriage with) Safiya.

Then he would sit beside his camel and let Safiya put her feet on his knees to ride (the camel)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":181},"chapter":{"id":111,"ara-name":"باب هَلْ يُسَافِرُ بِالْجَارِيَةِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَسْتَبْرِئَهَا","eng-name":"Travel with a slave-girl","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
