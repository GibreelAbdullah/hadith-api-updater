They are: -1. A man who possessed superfluous water on a way and he withheld it from travelers. -2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. -3. And a man who displayed his goods for sale after the `Asr prayer and he said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys them). The Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: \"Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":7},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب إِثْمِ مَنْ مَنَعَ ابْنَ السَّبِيلِ مِنَ الْمَاءِ","eng-name":"The sin of him who witholds water from travellers","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
