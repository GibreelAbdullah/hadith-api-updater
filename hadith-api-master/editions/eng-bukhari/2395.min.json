His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to the Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early in the morning and wandered among the date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for us","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":11},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا قَضَى دُونَ حَقِّهِ أَوْ حَلَّلَهُ فَهْوَ جَائِزٌ","eng-name":"If somebody repays less than what he owes","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
