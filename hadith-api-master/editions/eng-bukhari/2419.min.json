Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had taught it to me (in a different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round his neck and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered me to release him and asked Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, \"It was revealed in this way.\" He then asked me to recite it. When I recited it, he said, \"It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easier for you","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":9},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب كَلاَمِ الْخُصُومِ بَعْضِهِمْ فِي بَعْضٍ","eng-name":"The talk of opponents against each other","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
