The Prophet (ﷺ) stood up and said to them, \"I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I have delayed their distribution.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) had waited for them for more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became evident to them that the Prophet (ﷺ) was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, \"We choose our prisoners.\" The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and said, \"Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives).\" The people unanimously said, \"We do that (return the captives) willingly.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"We do not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders forward us your decision.\" So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet (ﷺ) that all the people had willingly given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about the captives of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that `Abbas said to the Prophet, \"I paid for my ransom and `Aqil's ransom","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":23},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ مَلَكَ مِنَ الْعَرَبِ رَقِيقًا فَوَهَبَ وَبَاعَ وَجَامَعَ وَفَدَى وَسَبَى الذُّرِّيَّةَ","eng-name":"Whoever possessed Arab slaves","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
