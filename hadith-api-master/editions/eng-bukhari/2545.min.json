The Prophet (ﷺ) asked me, 'Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":49,"hadith":28},"chapter":{"id":15,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ","eng-name":"\"Slaves are your brothers, so feed them with the like of what you eat.\"","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
