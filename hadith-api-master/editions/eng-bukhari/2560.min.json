They said that they would not agree to it unless her Wala' would be for them. 'Aishah further said, \"I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and told him about it.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to her, \"Buy Barira and manumit her and the Wala' will be for the liberator.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then got up and said, \"What about those people who stipulate conditions that are not present in Allah's Laws? If anybody stipulates a condition which is not in Allah's Laws, then what he stipulates is invalid.
