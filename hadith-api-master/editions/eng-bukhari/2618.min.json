There was a man who had about a Sa of wheat which was mixed with water then. A very tall pagan came driving sheep. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, \"Will you sell us (a sheep) or give it as a present?\" He said, \"I will sell you (a sheep).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) bought a sheep and it was slaughtered. The Prophet ordered that its liver and other Abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the Prophet (ﷺ) gave every person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of that; he gave all those of them who were present; and kept the shares of those who were absent. The Prophet (ﷺ) then put its meat in two huge basins and all of them ate to their fill, and even then more food was left in the two basins which were carried on the camel (or said something like it)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":50},"chapter":{"id":28,"ara-name":"باب قَبُولِ الْهَدِيَّةِ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ","eng-name":"The acceptance of presents from Al-Mushrikun","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
