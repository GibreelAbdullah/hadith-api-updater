The Muslims did not like this condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the Prophet (ﷺ) agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin `Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet (ﷺ) returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kulthum bint `Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and she was a young lady then. Her relative came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him to return her, but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not return her to them for Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: \"O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب مَا يَجُوزُ مِنَ الشُّرُوطِ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ وَالأَحْكَامِ وَالْمُبَايَعَةِ","eng-name":"The conditions permissible on embracing Islam, and in contracts and transactions","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
