She said, \"I presented the offer to them, but they refused unless the Wala' would be for them.\" When the Prophet (ﷺ) heard that and `Aisha told him about It, he said to her, \"Buy Barirah and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for them, as the Wala' is for the manumitted.\" `Aisha did so. After that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said, \"What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah's Laws? Any condition which is not in Allah's Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such conditions. Allah's Rules are the most valid and Allah's Conditions are the most solid.
