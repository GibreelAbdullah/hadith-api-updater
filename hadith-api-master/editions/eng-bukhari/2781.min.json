When the time of plucking the date-fruits came, I went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, \"O Allah's Apostle! you know that my father was martyred on Uhud's day and owed much debt, and I wish that the creditors would see you.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Go and collect the various kinds of dates and place them separately in heaps\"' I did accordingly and called him. On seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over it and said, \"Call your companions (i.e. the creditors).\" Then he kept on measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father's debts. By Allah, it would have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and I looked at the heap where Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sitting and noticed as if not a single date had been taken thereof","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":55,"hadith":44},"chapter":{"id":36,"ara-name":"باب قَضَاءِ الْوَصِيِّ دُيُونَ الْمَيِّتِ بِغَيْرِ مَحْضَرٍ مِنَ الْوَرَثَةِ","eng-name":"The payments of the debts of the deceased","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
