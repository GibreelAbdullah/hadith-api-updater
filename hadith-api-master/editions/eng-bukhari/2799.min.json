I said, 'What makes you smile?' He replied, 'Some of my followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings on thrones.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and told his dream) and Um Haram repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said, \"Invoke Allah to make me one of them.\" He said, \"You are among the first batch.\" Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband 'Ubada bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval expedition led by Mu'awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus she died","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":17},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ يُصْرَعُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَمَاتَ فَهُوَ مِنْهُمْ","eng-name":"The superiority of him who goes in Allah's Cause and dies on the way","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
