I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers.\" We used to think that the following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: \"Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah..........\" (33.23) His sister Ar-Rubbaya' broke a front tooth of a woman and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered for retaliation.

By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister's tooth shall not be broken.\" Then the opponents of Anas's sister accepted the compensation and gave up the claim of retaliation.
