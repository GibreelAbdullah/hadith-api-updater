The Prophet (ﷺ) reclined on the bed and turned his face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me and said protestingly, \"Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned his face towards him and said, \"Leave them.\" When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I waved the two girls to go away and they left. It was the day of `Id when negroes used to play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) or he himself asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, \"Carry on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!\" When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough. I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":120},"chapter":{"id":81,"ara-name":"باب الدَّرَقِ","eng-name":"The (leather) shield","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
