But the Prophet asked for `Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he ordered them to bring `Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) spat in his eyes and his eyes were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. `Ali said, \"We will fight with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":154},"chapter":{"id":102,"ara-name":"باب دُعَاءِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم إِلَى الإِسْلاَمِ وَالنُّبُوَّةِ، وَأَنْ لاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ","eng-name":"The invitation of the Prophet (ﷺ) ﷺ to embrace Islam","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
