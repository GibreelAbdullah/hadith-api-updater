Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Where is `Ali?\" He was told that `Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave him the flag. `Ali said, \"Should I fight them till they become like us (i.e. Muslim)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Go to them patiently and calmly till you enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them, for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than possessing red camels","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":218},"chapter":{"id":143,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ رَجُلٌ","eng-name":"The superiority of the one through whom a man embraces Islam","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
