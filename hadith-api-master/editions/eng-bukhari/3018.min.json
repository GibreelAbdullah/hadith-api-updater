So, they said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Provide us with some milk.\" Allah's Apostle said, \"I recommend that you should join the herd of camels.\" So they went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) till they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were Muslims. When the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and nobody provided them with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a sub-narrator said, \"They committed murder and theft and fought against Allah and His Apostle, and spread evil in the land)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":227},"chapter":{"id":152,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا حَرَّقَ الْمُشْرِكُ الْمُسْلِمَ هَلْ يُحَرَّقُ","eng-name":"If a Mushrik burns a Muslim, should he be burnt (in retaliation)?","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
