When I reached the mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf met me. I said to him, \"Woe to you! What brought you here?\" He replied, \"The she-camels of the Prophet (ﷺ) have been taken away.\" I said, \"Who took them?\" He said, \"Ghatafan and Fazara.\" So, I sent three cries, \"O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah !\" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them saying, \"I am the son of Al-Akwa`\"; and today perish the mean people!\" So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet (ﷺ) met me, I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so send some people to chase them.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O son of Al-Akwa`, you have gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them).
