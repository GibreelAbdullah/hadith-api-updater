When the Prophet entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palms as he wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet (ﷺ) while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, \"O Saf!\" (And this was his name). Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Had this woman let him to himself, he would have revealed the reality of his case.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) got up amongst the people, glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, \"I warn you about him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his nation of. You should understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah is not one-eyed","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":262},"chapter":{"id":178,"ara-name":"باب كَيْفَ يُعْرَضُ الإِسْلاَمُ عَلَى الصَّبِيِّ","eng-name":"How to present Islam to a (non-Muslim) boy","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
