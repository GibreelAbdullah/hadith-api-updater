So I proceeded with one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the Prophet (ﷺ) that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, 'O Allah!

The messenger of Jarir said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \"O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel (covered with tar).\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) invoked Allah to Bless the horses of the men of Ahmas five times","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":56,"hadith":281},"chapter":{"id":192,"ara-name":"باب الْبِشَارَةِ فِي الْفُتُوحِ","eng-name":"The conveyance of the good tidings of victories","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
