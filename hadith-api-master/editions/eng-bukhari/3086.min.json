Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get hurt?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied,\"No, but take care of the lady.\" Abu Talha covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his garment, and she got up.
