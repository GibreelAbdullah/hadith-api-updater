By Allah, if you give it to me, they will never be able to take it till I die.\" When `Ali bin Abu Talib demanded the hand of the daughter of Abi Jahal to be his wife besides Fatima, I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on his pulpit delivering a sermon in this connection before the people, and I had then attained my age of puberty. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be subjected to trials in her religion (because of jealousy).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was from the tribe of 'Abdi Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, \"Whatever he said was the truth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal thing illegal, nor do I make an illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the daughter of the enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as the wives of one man) (See Hadith No. 76, Vo)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":57,"hadith":19},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب مَا ذُكِرَ مِنْ دِرْعِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَعَصَاهُ وَسَيْفِهِ وَقَدَحِهِ وَخَاتَمِهِ","eng-name":"The armour of the Prophet (ﷺ) ﷺ","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
