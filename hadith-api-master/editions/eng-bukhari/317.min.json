Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed the Ihram for `Umra. \"Some of us assumed the Ihram for `Umra while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for `Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until the day of `Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet. He told me to postpone my `Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assume the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the night of Hasba, he sent my brother `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to at-Tan`im, where I assumed the Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, \"For that (`Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":22},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب نَقْضِ الْمَرْأَةِ شَعَرَهَا عِنْدَ غُسْلِ الْمَحِيضِ","eng-name":"A woman should undo her head-hair while taking the bath after finishing from her menses.","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
