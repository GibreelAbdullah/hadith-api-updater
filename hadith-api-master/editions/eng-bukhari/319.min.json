The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the Ihram for Hajj only and leave the `Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) sent `Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform `Umra from at-Tan`im in lieu of the missed `Umra","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":24},"chapter":{"id":18,"ara-name":"باب كَيْفَ تُهِلُّ الْحَائِضُ بِالْحَجِّ وَالْعُمْرَةِ","eng-name":"How a menstruating woman should assume Ihram for Hajj or for Umra","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
