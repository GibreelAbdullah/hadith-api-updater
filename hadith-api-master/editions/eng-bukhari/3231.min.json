So I departed, overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not relax till I found myself at Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head towards the sky to see a cloud shading me unexpectedly. I looked up and saw Gabriel in it. He called me saying, 'Allah has heard your people's saying to you, and what they have replied back to you, Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, \"O Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall on them.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"No but I hope that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None besides Him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":59,"hadith":42},"chapter":{"id":7,"ara-name":"بَابُ إِذَا قَالَ أَحَدُكُمْ آمِينَ. وَالْمَلاَئِكَةُ فِي السَّمَاءِ، فَوَافَقَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا الأُخْرَى، غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ","eng-name":"If anyone says Amin [during the Salat (prayer) at the end of the recitation of Surat Al-Fatiha]","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
