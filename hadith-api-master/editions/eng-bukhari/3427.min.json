A wolf came and took away the child of one of them, whereupon the other said, 'It has taken your child.' The first said, 'But it has taken your child.' So they both carried the case before David who judged that the living child be given to the elder lady. So both of them went to Solomon bin David and informed him (of the case). He said, 'Bring me a knife so as to cut the child into two pieces and distribute it between them.' The younger lady said, 'May Allah be merciful to you! Don't do that, for it is her (i.e. the other lady's) child.' So he gave the child to the younger lady","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":60,"hadith":98},"chapter":{"id":40,"ara-name":"بَابُ قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى: {وَوَهَبْنَا لِدَاوُدَ سُلَيْمَانَ نِعْمَ الْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ}","eng-name":"The Statement of Allah Taa'la: \"And to Dawud, We gave Sulaiman (for a son).
