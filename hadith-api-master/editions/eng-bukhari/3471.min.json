The cow said, \"We have not been created for this, but we have been created for sloughing.\" On that the people said astonishingly, \"Glorified be Allah! A cow speaks!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I believe this, and Abu Bakr and `Umar too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, 'You have saved it from me; but who will guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except me (because of riots and afflictions)? ' \" The people said surprisingly, \"Glorified be Allah! A wolf speaks!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"But I believe this, and Abu Bakr and `Umar too, believe this, although neither of them was present there.\" (See the Foot-note of page No. 10 Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":60,"hadith":138},"chapter":{"id":54,"ara-name":"باب","eng-name":"","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
