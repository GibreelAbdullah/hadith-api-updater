Bilal came out (of the tent) and pronounced the Adhan for the prayer, and entering again, he brought out the water which was left after Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had performed the ablution. The people rushed to take some of the water. Bilal again went in and brought out a spear-headed stick, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out. As if I were now looking at the whiteness of his leg. Bilal fixed the stick and the Prophet (ﷺ) offered a two-rak`at Zuhr prayer and a two-rak`at `Asr prayer, while women and donkeys were passing in front of the Prophet (beyond the stick)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":76},"chapter":{"id":23,"ara-name":"باب صِفَةِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم","eng-name":"The description of the Prophet (ﷺ)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
