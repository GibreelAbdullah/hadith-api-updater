Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the Prophet (ﷺ) before he was divinely inspired was an Aspostle), while he was sleeping in Al Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, \"Which of them is he?\" The second said, \"He is the best of them.\" That was all that happened then, and he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet (ﷺ) were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet (ﷺ) and ascended along with him to the Heaven","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":79},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَنَامُ عَيْنُهُ وَلاَ يَنَامُ قَلْبُهُ","eng-name":"The eyes of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to sleep, but his heart used not to sleep","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
