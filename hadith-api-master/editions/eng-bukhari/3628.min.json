So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he can either benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their good people (i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers.\" That was the last gathering which the Prophet (ﷺ) attended","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":61,"hadith":132},"chapter":{"id":25,"ara-name":"باب عَلاَمَاتِ النُّبُوَّةِ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ","eng-name":"The signs of Prophethood in Islam","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
