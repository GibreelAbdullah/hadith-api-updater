Ibn `Abbas, as if intending to encourage `Umar, said to him, \"O Chief of the believers! Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been in the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you.\" `Umar said, (to Ibn \"Abbas), \"As for what you have said about the company of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with it from the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":42},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب مَنَاقِبُ عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ أَبِي حَفْصٍ الْقُرَشِيِّ الْعَدَوِيِّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ","eng-name":"The merits of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab رضي الله عنه","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
