I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Qur'anic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja`far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":62,"hadith":58},"chapter":{"id":10,"ara-name":"بَابُ مَنَاقِبُ جَعْفَرِ بْنِ أَبِي طَالِبٍ","eng-name":"The merits of Ja'far bin Abi Talib رضي الله عنه","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
