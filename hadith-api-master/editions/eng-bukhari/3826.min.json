I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering.\" Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals, and used to say, \"Allah has created the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in other than the Name of Allah.
