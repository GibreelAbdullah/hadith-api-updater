We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":63,"hadith":119},"chapter":{"id":44,"ara-name":"باب تَزْوِيجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَائِشَةَ وَقُدُومُهَا الْمَدِينَةَ وَبِنَاؤُهُ بِهَا","eng-name":"Marriage of the Prophet (ﷺ) with ‘Aishah رضي الله عنها","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
