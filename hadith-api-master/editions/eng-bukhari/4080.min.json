The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) stopped me from doing so but the Prophet (ﷺ) did not stop me. Then the Prophet said, '(O Jabir.) don't weep over him, for the angels kept on covering him with their wings till his body was carried away (for burial)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":124},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ قُتِلَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ يَوْمَ أُحُدٍ","eng-name":"The Muslims who were killed on the day of Uhud","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
