I heard him reciting the poetic verses composed by Ibn Rawaha while he was carrying the earth, \"O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So, (O Allah), please send Sakina (i.e. calmness) upon us and make our feet firm if we meet the enemy, as they have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us, and fight against us) then we would not (flee but withstand them).\" The Prophet (ﷺ) would then prolong his voice at the last words","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":150},"chapter":{"id":29,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةُ الْخَنْدَقِ وَهْىَ الأَحْزَابُ","eng-name":"The Ghazwa of Al-Khandaq or Al-Ahzab Battle","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
