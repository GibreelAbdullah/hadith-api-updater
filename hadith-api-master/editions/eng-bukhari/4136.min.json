A man from the pagans came while the Prophet's sword was hanging on the tree. He took it out of its sheath secretly and said (to the Prophet (ﷺ) ), 'Are you afraid of me?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'No.' He said, 'Who can save you from me?' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, Allah.' The companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) threatened him, then the Iqama for the prayer was announced and the Prophet (ﷺ) offered a two rak`at Fear prayer with one of the two batches, and that batch went aside and he offered two rak`a-t with the other batch. So the Prophet (ﷺ) offered four rak`at but the people offered two rak`at only.\" (The subnarrator) Abu Bishr added, \"The man was Ghaurath bin Al-Harith and the battle was waged against Muharib Khasafa","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":180},"chapter":{"id":31,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةُ ذَاتِ الرِّقَاعِ","eng-name":"The Ghazwa of Dhat-ur-Riqa","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
