When the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed of that, he came and sat on its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his mouth), invoked (Allah), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our riding animals","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":194},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةِ الْحُدَيْبِيَةِ","eng-name":"The Ghazwa of Al-Hudaibiya","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
