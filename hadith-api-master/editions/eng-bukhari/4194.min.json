The shecamels of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to graze at a place called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf met me (on the way) and said, \"The she-camels of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been taken away by force.\" I asked, \"Who had taken them?\" He replied \"(The people of) Ghatafan.\" I made three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, \"O Sabahah!\" I made the people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as I was a good archer and I was saying, \"I am the son of Al-Akwa`, and today will perish the wicked people.\" I kept on saying like that till I restored the shecamels (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) and the other people came there, and I said, \"O Allah's Prophet! I have stopped the people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people) after them now.\" On that the Prophet said, \"O the son of Al-Akwa`! You have over-powered them, so forgive them.\" Then we all came back and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) seated me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":234},"chapter":{"id":37,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةُ ذَاتِ الْقَرَدِ","eng-name":"Ghazwa Dhat-Qarad","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
