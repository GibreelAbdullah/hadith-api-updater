And if they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers to be performed every day and night. And if they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Sadaqa (i.e. rak`at) to be taken from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them. And if they obey you in that, then be cautious! Don't take their best properties (as Zakat) and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person as there is no screen between his invocation and Allah","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":374},"chapter":{"id":60,"ara-name":"باب بَعْثُ أَبِي مُوسَى وَمُعَاذٍ إِلَى الْيَمَنِ قَبْلَ حَجَّةِ الْوَدَاعِ","eng-name":"Sending Abu Musa and Mu'adh to Yemen","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
