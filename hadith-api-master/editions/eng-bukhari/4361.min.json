We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal (i.e. a fish) called Al-`Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, \"He took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from underneath it (without touching it). \" Jabir added: There was a man amongst the people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so. Narrated Abu Salih: Qais bin Sa`d said to his father. \"I was present in the army and the people were struck with severe hunger.\" He said, \"You should have slaughtered (camels) (for them).\" Qais said, \"I did slaughter camels but they were hungry again. He said, \"You should have slaughtered (camels) again.\" Qais said, \"I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt hungry again.\" He said, \"You should have slaughtered (camels) again.\" Qais said, \"I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry.\" He said, \"You should have slaughtered (camels) again.\" Qais said, \"But I was forbidden (by Abu 'Ubaida this time)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":387},"chapter":{"id":65,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةُ سِيفِ الْبَحْرِ وَهُمْ يَتَلَقَّوْنَ عِيرًا لِقُرَيْشٍ وَأَمِيرُهُمْ أَبُو عُبَيْدَةَ","eng-name":"The Ghazwa of the sea-coast","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
