So we came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he considered the biter's claim as invalid (i.e. the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Should he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a male camel to snap it?","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":439},"chapter":{"id":78,"ara-name":"باب غَزْوَةُ تَبُوكَ، وَهْىَ غَزْوَةُ الْعُسْرَةِ","eng-name":"Ghazwa of Tabuk, also called Ghazwa Al-‘Usrah","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
