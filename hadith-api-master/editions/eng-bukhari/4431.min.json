And how great that Thursday was! The ailment of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) became worse (on Thursday) and he said, \"Fetch me something so that I may write to you something after which you will never go astray.\" The people (present there) differed in this matter, and it was not right to differ before a prophet. Some said, \"What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask him ( to understand his state ).\" So they went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and asked him again. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me for.\" Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, \"Turn the pagans out of the 'Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with them.\" (Sa`id bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn `Abbas kept quiet as regards the third order, or he said, \"I forgot it.\") (See Hadith No. 116 Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":64,"hadith":453},"chapter":{"id":83,"ara-name":"بَابُ مَرَضِ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَوَفَاتِهِ","eng-name":"The sickness of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his death","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
