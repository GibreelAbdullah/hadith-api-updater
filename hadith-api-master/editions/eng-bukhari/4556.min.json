The Prophet (ﷺ) said to them, \"How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?\" They replied, \"We blacken their faces with coal and beat them,\" He said, \"Don't you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?\" They replied, \"We do not find anything in it.\" `Abdullah bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. \"You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful.\" (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar- Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. `Abdullah bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher's) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, \"What is this?\" So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, \"This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":78},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب {قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِالتَّوْرَاةِ فَاتْلُوهَا إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ}","eng-name":"\"Say (O Muḥammad ﷺ): Bring here the Taurāt (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful.\" (V.3:93)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
