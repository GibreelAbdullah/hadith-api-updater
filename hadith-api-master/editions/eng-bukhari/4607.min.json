Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed there to look for it, and so did the people along with him. Neither were they at a place of water, nor did they have any water with them. So the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, \"Don't you see what `Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the people, stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.\" Abu Bakr came while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said (to me), \"You have detained Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the people where there is no water, and they have no water with them.\" So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say, and he hit me on my flanks with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my thigh. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up when dawn broke and there was no water, so Allah revealed the Verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, \"It is not the first blessing of yours, O the family of Abu Bakr.\" Then we made the camel on which I was riding get up, and found the necklace under it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":129},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِهِ {فَلَمْ تَجِدُوا مَاءً فَتَيَمَّمُوا صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا}","eng-name":"Allah's Statement: \"...And you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth...\" (V.5:6)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
