You will be gathered before Allah barefooted, naked and not circumcised.\" Then (quoting Qur'an) he said:-- \"As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. A promise We have undertaken: Truly We shall do it..\" (21.104) The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, \"The first of the human beings to be dressed on the Day of Resurrection, will be Abraham. Lo! Some men from my followers will be brought and then (the angels) will drive them to the left side (Hell-Fire). I will say. 'O my Lord! (They are) my companions!' Then a reply will come (from the Almighty), 'You do not know what they did after you.' I will say as the pious slave (the Prophet Jesus (ﷺ)) said: And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up, You were the Watcher over them and You are a Witness to all things.' (5.117) Then it will be said, \"These people have continued to be apostates since you left them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":147},"chapter":{"id":14,"ara-name":"باب {وَكُنْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا مَا دُمْتُ فِيهِمْ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيْتَنِي كُنْتَ أَنْتَ الرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ}","eng-name":"\"And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them; but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.\" (V.5:117)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
