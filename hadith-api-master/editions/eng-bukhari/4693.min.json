Allah said:-- \"Then watch you (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce a kind of smoke plainly visible.\" (44.10) And Allah further said:-- \"Verily! We shall withdraw the punishment a little, Verily you will return (to disbelief).\" (44.15) (Will Allah relieve them from torture on the Day of Resurrection?)
