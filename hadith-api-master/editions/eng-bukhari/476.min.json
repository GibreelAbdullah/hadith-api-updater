Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abu Bakr thought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did so. He used to pray and recite the Qur'an in it. The pagan women and their children used to stand by him and look at him with surprise. Abu Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting the Qur'an. The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of that (i.e. that their children and women might be affected by the recitation of Qur'an)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":124},"chapter":{"id":86,"ara-name":"باب الْمَسْجِدِ يَكُونُ فِي الطَّرِيقِ مِنْ غَيْرِ ضَرَرٍ بِالنَّاسِ","eng-name":"(If) a mosque (is built) on a road, it should not be a cause of harm for the people","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
