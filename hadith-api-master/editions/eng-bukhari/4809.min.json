If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, \"Allah knows better,' for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, 'Allah knows better.' Allah said to His Prophet: 'Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Qur'an) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).'

People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.'

(44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?\" `Abdullah added, \"The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr.
