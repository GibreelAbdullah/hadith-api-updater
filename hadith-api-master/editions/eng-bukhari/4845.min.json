They were Abu Bakr and `Umar who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ) when a mission from Bani Tamim came to him. One of the two recommended Al-Aqra' bin Habis, the brother of Bani Mujashi (to be their governor) while the other recommended somebody else. (Nafi`, the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name). Abu Bakr said to `Umar, \"You wanted nothing but to oppose me!\" `Umar said, \"I did not intend to oppose you.\" Their voices grew loud in that argument, so Allah revealed: 'O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.' (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"Since the revelation of this Verse, `Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet (ﷺ) had to ask him to repeat his statements.\" But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":65,"hadith":366},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب {لاَ تَرْفَعُوا أَصْوَاتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ النَّبِيِّ} الآيَةَ","eng-name":"\"O you who believe!
