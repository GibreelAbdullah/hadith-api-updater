Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Qur'an) as Jews and the Christians did before.\" So `Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, \"Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.\" Hafsa sent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, Sa`id bin Al-As and `AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. `Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, \"In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue.\" They did so, and when they had written many copies, `Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. `Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":66,"hadith":9},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب جَمْعِ الْقُرْآنِ","eng-name":"The collection of the Qur'an","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
