I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, \"Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?\" He replied, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught it to me.\" I said, \"You have told a lie, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) has taught it to me in a different way from yours.\" So I dragged him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said (to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)), \"I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!\" On that Allah's Apostle said, \"Release him, (O `Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!\" Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"It was revealed in this way,\" and added, \"Recite, O `Umar!\" I recited it as he had taught me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, \"It was revealed in this way. This Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":66,"hadith":14},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب أُنْزِلَ الْقُرْآنُ عَلَى سَبْعَةِ أَحْرُفٍ","eng-name":"The Qur'an was revealed to be recited in seven different ways","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
