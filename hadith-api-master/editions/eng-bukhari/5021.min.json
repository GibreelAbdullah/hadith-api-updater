Your example and the example of the Jews and Christians is that of person who employed laborers and said to them, \"Who will work for me till the middle of the day for one Qirat (a special weight)?' The Jews did. He then said, \"Who will work for me from the middle of the day till the `Asr prayer for one Qirat each?\" The Christians worked accordingly. Then you (Muslims) are working from the `Asr prayer till the Maghrib prayer for two Qirats each. They (the Jews and the Christians) said, 'We did more labor but took less wages.'

They replied, 'No.' Then He said, 'This is My Blessing which I give to whom I wish","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":66,"hadith":43},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ الْقُرْآنِ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْكَلاَمِ","eng-name":"The superiority of the Qur'an above other kinds of speech","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
