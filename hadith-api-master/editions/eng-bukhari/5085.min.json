I invited the Muslims to the wedding banquet in which neither meat nor bread was offered. He ordered for leather dining-sheets to be spread, and dates, dried yoghurt and butter were laid on it, and that was the Prophet's wedding banquet. The Muslims wondered, \"Is she (Saffiyya) considered as his wife or his slave girl?\" Then they said, \"If he orders her to veil herself, she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order her to veil herself, she will be a slave girl. So when the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded from there, he spared her a space behind him (on his shecamel) and put a screening veil between her and the people","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":67,"hadith":23},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب اتِّخَاذِ السَّرَارِيِّ","eng-name":"Having female captives and manumitting one's own slave-girl","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
