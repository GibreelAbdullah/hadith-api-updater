One may say: 'I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to Allah; you are fit to remarry.' She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what you say,' but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":67,"hadith":60},"chapter":{"id":34,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ اللَّهِ جَلَّ وَعَزَّ : {وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ النِّسَاءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنْتُمْ فِي أَنْفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ} الآيَةَ إِلَى قَوْلِهِ: {غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ}","eng-name":"\"And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal or conceal it in yourself...\"","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
