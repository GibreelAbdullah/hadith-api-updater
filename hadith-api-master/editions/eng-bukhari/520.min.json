One of them said, 'Don't you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the Abdominal contents (intestines, etc.) of the slaughtered camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his shoulders?' The most unfortunate amongst them (`Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait) went (and brought them) and when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the Prophet (ﷺ) was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their faces. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) completed his prayer, he said, 'O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and added, 'O Allah! take revenge on `Amr bin Hisham, `Utba bin Rabi`a, Shaiba bin Rabi`a, Al-Walid bin `Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, `Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait and `Umara bin Al-Walid.\" `Abdullah added, \"By Allah! I saw all of them dead in the battle field on the day of Badr and they were dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well) at Badr: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, 'Allah's curse has descended upon the people of the Qalib (well)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":167},"chapter":{"id":109,"ara-name":"باب الْمَرْأَةِ تَطْرَحُ عَنِ الْمُصَلِّي، شَيْئًا مِنَ الأَذَى","eng-name":"A woman can remove troublesome or offensive things from a person in Salat (prayer)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
