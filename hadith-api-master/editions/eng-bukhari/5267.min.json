So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet (ﷺ) came to anyone of us, she should say him, \"I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' \" So the Prophet (ﷺ) visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore.\" So there was revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,' (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. 'When the Prophet (ﷺ) disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.'
