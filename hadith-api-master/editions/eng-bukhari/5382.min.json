After a while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, 'Will you sell us (a sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?\" The pagan said, \"No, but I will sell it \" So the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that the liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By Allah, none of those one hundred and thirty men but had his share of those things. The Prophet (ﷺ) gave to those who were present, and also kept a share for those who were absent He then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we all ate together our fill; yet there remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":70,"hadith":10},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ أَكَلَ حَتَّى شَبِعَ","eng-name":"Whoever ate till he was satisfied","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
