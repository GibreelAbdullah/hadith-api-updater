He said, \"If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.\" I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, \"If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah's name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":72,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب التَّسْمِيَةِ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ","eng-name":"The mentioning of Allah's Name while hunting","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
