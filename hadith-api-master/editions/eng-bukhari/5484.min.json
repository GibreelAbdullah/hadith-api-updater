But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, joined other hounds, and Allah's Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not eat of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":72,"hadith":10},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب الصَّيْدِ إِذَا غَابَ عَنْهُ يَوْمَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلاَثَةً","eng-name":"If the hunter hits a game but does not catch it till two or three days","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
