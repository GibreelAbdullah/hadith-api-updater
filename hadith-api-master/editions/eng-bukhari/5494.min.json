But we were struck with such severe hunger that we ate the Khabat (desert bushes), so our army was called the Army of the Khabat. Then the sea threw a huge fish called Al-`Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":72,"hadith":20},"chapter":{"id":12,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى {أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ صَيْدُ الْبَحْرِ}","eng-name":"\"Lawful to you is water-game and its use for food ....
