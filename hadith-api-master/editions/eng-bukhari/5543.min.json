I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.\" The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet (ﷺ) was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":72,"hadith":68},"chapter":{"id":36,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا أَصَابَ قَوْمٌ غَنِيمَةً فَذَبَحَ بَعْضُهُمْ غَنَمًا أَوْ إِبِلاً بِغَيْرِ أَمْرِ أَصْحَابِهِمْ لَمْ تُؤْكَلْ","eng-name":"To slaughter sheep or camels from war booty without the permission of the companions","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
