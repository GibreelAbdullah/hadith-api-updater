The people of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted (upon it) till midday then they were exhausted and were given one Qirat (of gold) each. And then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted (upon it) till the `Asr prayer then they were exhausted and were given one Qirat each. And then we were given the Qur'an and we acted (upon it) till sunset and we were given two Qirats each. On that the people of both the scriptures said, 'O our Lord! You have given them two Qirats and given us one Qirat, though we have worked more than they.' Allah said, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They said, 'No.' Allah said: \"That is my blessing I bestow upon whomsoever I wish","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ أَدْرَكَ رَكْعَةً مِنَ الْعَصْرِ قَبْلَ الْغُرُوبِ","eng-name":"Whoever got (or was able to offer) only one Rak'a of the 'Asr prayer before sunset","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
