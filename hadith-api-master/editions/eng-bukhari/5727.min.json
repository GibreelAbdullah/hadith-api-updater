We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers,\" and they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered that they be given some camels and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that their eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in that state","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":76,"hadith":42},"chapter":{"id":29,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ خَرَجَ مِنْ أَرْضٍ لاَ تُلاَيِمُهُ","eng-name":"Whoever went out of a land because of its climate and water","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
