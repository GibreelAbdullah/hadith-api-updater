I saw a whitish brown man, the handsomest of all brown men you might ever see. He had the most beautiful Limma (hair hanging down to the earlobes) you might ever see. He had combed it and it was dripping water; and he was performing the Tawaf around the Ka`ba leaning on two men or on the shoulders of two men. I asked, \"Who is this?\" It was said. \"Messiah, the son of Mary.\" Suddenly I saw a curly-haired man, blind in the right eye which looked like a protruding out grape.
