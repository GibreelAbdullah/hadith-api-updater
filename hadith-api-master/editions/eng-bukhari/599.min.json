(The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet (ﷺ) preferred to pray the `Isha' late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 'Ayat' (verses) of the Qur'an in it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":74},"chapter":{"id":39,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُكْرَهُ مِنَ السَّمَرِ بَعْدَ الْعِشَاءِ","eng-name":"What is disliked about talking after the 'Isha prayer","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
