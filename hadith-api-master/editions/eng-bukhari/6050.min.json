The man mentioned (complained about) me to the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Did you abuse so-and-so?\" I said, \"Yes\" He said, \"Did you call his mother bad names?\" I said, \"Yes\". He said, \"You still have the traits of (the Pre-Islamic period of) ignorance.\" I said. \"(Do I still have ignorance) even now in my old age?\" He said, \"Yes, they (slaves or servants) are your brothers, and Allah has put them under your command.
