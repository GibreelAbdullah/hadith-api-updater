It does not mean that dawn or morning has started.\" Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas`ud imitated the gesture of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":19},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب الأَذَانِ قَبْلَ الْفَجْرِ","eng-name":"The Adhan before Al-Fajr (dawn)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
