The Prophet (ﷺ) showed as if he wanted to get up, but they did not get up. When he noticed that, he got up, and some of the people also got up and went away, while some others kept on sitting. When the Prophet (ﷺ) returned to enter, he found the people still sitting, but then they got up and left. So I told the Prophet (ﷺ) of their departure and he came and went in. I intended to go in but the Prophet (ﷺ) put a screen between me and him, for Allah revealed:-- 'O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":79,"hadith":13},"chapter":{"id":10,"ara-name":"باب آيَةِ الْحِجَابِ","eng-name":"The Divine Verse of Al-Hijab","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
