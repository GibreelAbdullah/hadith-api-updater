Abu Musa replied, \"I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the permission is not given, then he should return.' \" `Umar said, \"By Allah! We will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it.\" (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the Ansar and said). \"Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet (ﷺ) ?\" Ubai bin Ka`b said, \"By Allah, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a witness).\" (Abu Sa`id) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed `Umar that the Prophet (ﷺ) had said so.
