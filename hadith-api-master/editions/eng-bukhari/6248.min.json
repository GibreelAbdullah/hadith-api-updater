She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer.\" (See Hadith No. 60, Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":79,"hadith":22},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب تَسْلِيمِ الرِّجَالِ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ وَالنِّسَاءِ عَلَى الرِّجَالِ","eng-name":"Greeting of men to women, and women to men","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
