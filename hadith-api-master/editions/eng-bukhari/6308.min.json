(Ibn Mas`ud added): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then says, 'I will go back to my place.' He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":80,"hadith":5},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب التَّوْبَةِ","eng-name":"At-Tauba","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
