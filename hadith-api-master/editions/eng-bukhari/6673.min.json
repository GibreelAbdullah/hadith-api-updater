So his family slaughtered (the animal ) before the prayer. Then they mentioned that event to the Prophet who ordered Al-Bara to slaughter another sacrifice. Al-Bara' said to the Prophet (ﷺ) , \"I have a young milch she-goat which is better than two sheep for slaughtering.\" (The sub-narrator, Ibn 'Aun used to say, \"I don't know whether the permission (to slaughter a she-goat as a sacrifice) was especially given to Al-Bara' or if it was in general for all the Muslims.\") (See Hadith No. 99, Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":83,"hadith":51},"chapter":{"id":15,"ara-name":"بَابُ إِذَا حَنِثَ نَاسِيًا فِي الأَيْمَانِ","eng-name":"If someone does something against his oath due to forgetfulness","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
