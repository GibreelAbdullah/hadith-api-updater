The Prophet (ﷺ) came to pay me a visit. I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have much property and no heir except my single daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my property in charity?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"Half of it?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"Onethird of it?\" He said, \"You may do so) though one-third is also to a much, for it is better for you to leave your off-spring wealthy than to leave them poor, asking others for help. And whatever you spend (for Allah's sake) you will be rewarded for it, even for a morsel of food which you may put in the mouth of your wife.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Will I remain behind and fail to complete my emigration?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If you are left behind after me, whatever good deeds you will do for Allah's sake, that will upgrade you and raise you high. May be you will have long life so that some people may benefit by you and others (the enemies) be harmed by you.\" But Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt sorry for Sa`d bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.
