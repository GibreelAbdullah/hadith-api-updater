Sa`d said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! (This is) the son of my brother and he told me to be his custodian.\" Then 'Abu bin Zam`a said, \"(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, born on his bed.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"This child is for you. O 'Abu bin Zam`a, as the child is for the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones.\" He then ordered (his wife) Sauda bint Zam`a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to `Utba. Since then the boy had never seen Sauda till he died","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":85,"hadith":26},"chapter":{"id":18,"ara-name":"باب الْوَلَدُ لِلْفِرَاشِ حُرَّةً كَانَتْ أَوْ أَمَةً","eng-name":"The child is for the owner of the bed","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
