Provide us with milk.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah's Apostle.\" So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came to Allah's Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized. Then they were put at a place called Al- Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, \"Those people committed theft and murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":86,"hadith":33},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب لَمْ يُسْقَ الْمُرْتَدُّونَ الْمُحَارِبُونَ حَتَّى مَاتُوا","eng-name":"No water was given to those turned renegades and fought, till they died","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
