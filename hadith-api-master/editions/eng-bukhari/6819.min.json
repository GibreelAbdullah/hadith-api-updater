The Prophet (ﷺ) asked them. \"What is the legal punishment (for this sin) in your Book (Torah)?\" They replied, \"Our priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and Tajbiya.\" `Abdullah bin Salam said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), tell them to bring the Torah.\" The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, \"Lift up your hand.\" Behold! The Divine Verse of the Rajam was under his hand. So Allah's Apostle ordered that the two (sinners) be stoned to death, and so they were stoned. Ibn `Umar added: So both of them were stoned at the Balat and I saw the Jew sheltering the Jewess","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":86,"hadith":47},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب الرَّجْمِ فِي الْبَلاَطِ","eng-name":"The Rajm at the Balat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
