Give your verdict according to Allah's Laws (in our case).\" Then his opponent got up and said, \"He has told the truth, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Decide his case according to Allah's Laws. My son was a laborer working for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah's Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais! Go to the wife of this man (and if she confesses), stone her to death.\" So Unais went in the morning and stoned her to death (after she had confessed)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":0,"hadith":0},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng_name":null,"isFirstHadith":null}}]}
