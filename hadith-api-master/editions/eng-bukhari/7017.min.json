So, if someone has a dream which he dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer.\" He added, \"He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream) and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet symbolizes one's constant and firm adherence to religion.\" And Abu `Abdullah said, \"Ghuls (iron collars) are used only for necks","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":91,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"باب الْقَيْدِ فِي الْمَنَامِ","eng-name":"(Seeing) oneself fettered in a dream","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
