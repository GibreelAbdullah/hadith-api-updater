When he came to know that Mu`adh had criticized him, he went to the Prophet, and complained against Mu`adh. The Prophet said thrice, \"O Mu`adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?\" It would have been better if you had recited \"Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-A`la (87)\", Wash-shamsi wa duhaha (91)\", or \"Wal-laili idha yaghsha (92)\", for the old, the weak and the needy pray behind you.\" Jabir said that Mu`adh recited Sura Al-Baqara in the `Isha' prayer","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":100},"chapter":{"id":63,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ شَكَا إِمَامَهُ إِذَا طَوَّلَ","eng-name":"Complaining against one's Imam if he prolongs the prayer.","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
