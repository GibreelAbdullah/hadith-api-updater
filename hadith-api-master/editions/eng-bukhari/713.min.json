He said, \"Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Abu Bakr is a softhearted man and if he stands in your place, he would not be able to make the people hear him. Will you order `Umar (to lead the prayer)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.\" Then I said to Hafsa, \"Tell him, Abu i Bakr is a softhearted man and if he stands in his place, he would not be able to make the people hear him. Would you order `Umar to lead the prayer?' \" Hafsa did so. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Verily you are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.\" So Abu- Bakr stood for the prayer. In the meantime Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) felt better and came out with the help of two persons and both of his legs were dragging on the ground till he entered the mosque. When Abu Bakr heard him coming, he tried to retreat but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) beckoned him to carry on. The Prophet (ﷺ) sat on his left side. Abu Bakr was praying while standing and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was leading the prayer while sitting. Abu Bakr was following the Prophet (ﷺ) and the people were following Abu Bakr (in the prayer)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":108},"chapter":{"id":68,"ara-name":"باب الرَّجُلُ يَأْتَمُّ بِالإِمَامِ وَيَأْتَمُّ النَّاسُ بِالْمَأْمُومِ","eng-name":"If a person follows the Imam and the others follow that person (then it is all right)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
