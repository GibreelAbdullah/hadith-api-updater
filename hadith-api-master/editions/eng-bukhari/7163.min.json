Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to give me gifts and I used to say to him, 'Give it to a more needy one than me.' Once he gave me some money and I said, 'Give it to a more needy person than me,' whereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Take it and keep it in your possession and then give it in charity. Take what ever comes to you of this money if you are not keen to have it and not asking for it; otherwise (i.e., if it does not come to you) do not seek to have it yourself","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":93,"hadith":27},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب رِزْقِ الْحُكَّامِ وَالْعَامِلِينِ عَلَيْهَا","eng-name":"The salaries of rulers and those employed to administer the funds","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
