After finishing it with Taslim, he stood on the pulpit and mentioned the Hour and mentioned there would happen great events before it. Then he said, \"Whoever wants to ask me any question, may do so, for by Allah, you will not ask me about anything but I will inform you of its answer as long as I am at this place of mine.\" On this, the Ansar wept violently, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on saying, \"Ask Me! \" Then a man got up and asked, ''Where will my entrance be, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"(You will go to) the Fire.\" Then `Abdullah bin Hudhaifa got up and asked, \"Who is my father, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"Your father is Hudhaifa.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then kept on saying (angrily), \"Ask me! Ask me!\" `Umar then knelt on his knees and said, \"We have accepted Allah as our Lord and Islam as our religion and Muhammad as an Apostle.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) became quiet when `Umar said that. Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my life is, Paradise and Hell were displayed before me across this wall while I was praying, and I never saw such good and evil as I have seen today","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":96,"hadith":25},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُكْرَهُ مِنْ كَثْرَةِ السُّؤَالِ وَتَكَلُّفِ مَا لاَ يَعْنِيهِ","eng-name":"Asking too many questions and troubling with what does not concern one","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
