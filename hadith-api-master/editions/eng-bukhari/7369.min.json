He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but `Ali said, \"Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.\" So the Prophet (ﷺ) asked Barira (my salve girl), \"Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?\" She replied, \"I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) stood on the pulpit and said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.\" The narrator added: Then the Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned the innocence of `Aisha.
