O Allah! Forgive me my sins that I did in the past or will do in the future, and also the sins I did in secret or in public. You are my only God (Whom I worship) and there is no other God for me (i.e. I worship none but You).\" Narrated Sufyan: (regarding the above narration) that the Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"You are the Truth, and Your Word is the Truth","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":15},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"بَابُ قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى: {وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ}","eng-name":"“And it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in truth…”","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
