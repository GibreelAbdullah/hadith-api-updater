He sent (her a message), \"What ever Allah takes is for Him, and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything has a limited fixed term (in this world) so she should be patient and hope for Allah's reward.\" She then sent for him again, swearing that he should come. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up, and so did Mu`adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka`b and 'Ubada bin As-Samit. When he entered (the house), they gave the child to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) while its breath was disturbed in his chest. (The sub-narrator said: I think he said, \"...as if it was a water skin.\") Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started weeping whereupon Sa`d bin 'Ubada said, \"Do you weep?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":74},"chapter":{"id":25,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى {إِنَّ رَحْمَةَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ}","eng-name":"“…Surely, Allah’s Mercy is near unto the good-doers.”","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
