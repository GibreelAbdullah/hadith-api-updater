The people of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the `Asr prayer, and then they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were given the Qur'an and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each (double the reward of the previous nations).\" Then the people of the Torah said, 'O our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a greater reward.' Allah said, 'Have I withheld anything from your reward?' They said, 'No.' Then Allah said, 'That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":93},"chapter":{"id":31,"ara-name":"باب فِي الْمَشِيئَةِ وَالإِرَادَةِ","eng-name":"(Allah’s) Wish and Will","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
