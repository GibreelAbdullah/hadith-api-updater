I was about to jump over him while He was still in prayer, but I waited patiently and when he finished his prayer, I put my sheet round his neck (and pulled him) and said, \"Who has taught you this Sura which I have heard you reciting?\" Hisham said, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught it to me.\" I said, \"You are telling a lie, for he taught it to me in a way different from the way you have recited it!\" Then I started leading (dragged) him to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said (to the Prophet), \" I have heard this man reciting Surat-al- Furqan in a way that you have not taught me.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"(O `Umar) release him! Recite, O Hisham.\" Hisham recited in the way I heard him reciting. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"It was revealed like this.\" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Recite, O `Umar!\" I recited in the way he had taught me, whereupon he said, \"It was revealed like this,\" and added, \"The Qur'an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever is easy for you .\" (See Hadith No. 514, Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":175},"chapter":{"id":53,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى {فَاقْرَءُوا مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ}","eng-name":"“…So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy for you….”","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
