Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah? It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Allah's Cause). And I forbid you four things, (i.e., Do not drink alcoholic drinks) Ad-Dubba, An- Naqir, (pitched water skins), Az-Zuruf, Al-Muzaffat and Al--Hantam (names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).\" (See Hadith No. 50, Vol)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":97,"hadith":181},"chapter":{"id":56,"ara-name":"باب قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى {وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ}","eng-name":"“While Allah has created you and what you make!”","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
