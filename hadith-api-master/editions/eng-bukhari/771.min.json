He replied, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) used to offer the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon; the `Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet (ﷺ) never found any harm in delaying the `Isha' prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the rak`at","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":165},"chapter":{"id":104,"ara-name":"باب الْقِرَاءَةِ فِي الْفَجْرِ","eng-name":"The recitation of the Qur'an in the Fajr prayer","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
