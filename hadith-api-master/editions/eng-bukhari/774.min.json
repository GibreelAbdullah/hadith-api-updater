When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, \"You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other.\" He said, \"I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right ; otherwise I will leave you.\" They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet (ﷺ) went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet (ﷺ) addressed him and said, \"O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do ? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a ?\" He repiled, \"I love this Surah.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":169},"chapter":{"id":106,"ara-name":"باب الْجَمْعِ بَيْنَ السُّورَتَيْنِ فِي الرَّكْعَةِ","eng-name":"To recite two Surah in one Rak'a and to recite the last verses of some Surah, or to elite the Surah in their reverse order, or to recite the beginning of a Surah","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
