(And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":21},"chapter":{"id":20,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ عَلِمَ وَعَلَّمَ","eng-name":"The superiority of a person who learns (Islam, becomes a religious scholar) and then teaches it to others","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
