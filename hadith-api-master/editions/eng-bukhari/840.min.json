I heard from `Itban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, \"I used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said to him, 'I have weak eyesight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe and I wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as a place for praying (mosque). He said, \"Allah willing, I shall do that.\" Next day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) along with Abu Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gave him permission, but he didn't sit till he said to me, \"Where do you want me to pray in your house?\" I pointed to a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and we aligned behind him. He completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":232},"chapter":{"id":154,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ لَمْ يَرَ رَدَّ السَّلاَمِ عَلَى الإِمَامِ وَاكْتَفَى بِتَسْلِيمِ الصَّلاَةِ","eng-name":"Whoever did not say (a Taslim) in addition to the Taslim of the Imam but thought that Taslim of the Salat (prayer) was sufficient","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
