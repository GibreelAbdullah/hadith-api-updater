He used to go one day and I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and asked if I was there.\" I became horrified and came out to him. He said, \"Today a great thing has happened.\" I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked her, \"Did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) divorce you all?\" She replied, \"I do not know.\" Then, I entered upon the Prophet (ﷺ) and said while standing, \"Have you divorced your wives?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied in the negative. On that I said, \"Allahu-Akbar (Allah is Greater).\" (See Hadith No. 119, Vol. 3 for details)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":31},"chapter":{"id":27,"ara-name":"باب التَّنَاوُبِ فِي الْعِلْمِ","eng-name":"To fix the duties in rotation for learning (religious) knowledge","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
