They asked him about it and he said, \"By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was made, and no doubt I saw it on the very first day when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took his seat on it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, 'Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.' So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, 'I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":41},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"باب الْخُطْبَةِ عَلَى الْمِنْبَرِ","eng-name":"(to deliver) the Khutba on the pulpit","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
