He gave to some men and ignored the others. Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he glorified and praised Allah and said, \"Amma ba'du. By Allah, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-content with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and `Amr bin Taghlib is one of them.\" `Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah's Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":47},"chapter":{"id":29,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ قَالَ فِي الْخُطْبَةِ بَعْدَ الثَّنَاءِ أَمَّا بَعْدُ","eng-name":"Saying \"Ammaba'du\" in the Khutba","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
