On Fridays she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would give us that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look forward to Friday","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":62},"chapter":{"id":40,"ara-name":"بَابُ قَوْلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى: {فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلاَةُ فَانْتَشِرُوا فِي الأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِنْ فَضْلِ اللَّهِ}","eng-name":"When the Salat is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek of the Bounty of Allah","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
