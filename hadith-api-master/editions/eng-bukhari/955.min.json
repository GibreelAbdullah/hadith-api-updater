And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the `Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice.\" Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have slaughtered my sheep before the `Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So I slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk).\" He (Abu Burda) said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? \"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":7},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب الأَكْلِ يَوْمَ النَّحْرِ","eng-name":"Eating on the day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijjah)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
