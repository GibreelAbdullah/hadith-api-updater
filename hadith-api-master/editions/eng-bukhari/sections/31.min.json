A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, 'Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, 'Umar remarked, 'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":3},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ","eng-name":"The superiority of Nawafil at night in Ramadan","isFirstHadith":false}},{"hadithnumber":2011,"arabicnumber":2011,"text":"Narrated `Aisha:(the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to pray (at night) in Ramadan","grades":[{"name":"Imam Bukhari","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":4},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ","eng-name":"The superiority of Nawafil at night in Ramadan","isFirstHadith":false}},{"hadithnumber":2012,"arabicnumber":2012,"text":"Narrated 'Urwa:That he was informed by `Aisha, \"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him.
