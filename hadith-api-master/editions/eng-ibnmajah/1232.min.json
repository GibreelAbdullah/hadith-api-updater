He said, ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ We said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man, and when he takes your place he will weep and not be able to do it. Why do you not tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer?’ He said: ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer; you are (like) the female companions of Yusuf.’” She said: “So we sent word to Abu Bakr, and he led the people in prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) began to feel a little better, so he came out to the prayer, supported by two men with his feet making lines along the ground. When Abu Bakr realized that he was there, he wanted to step back, but the Prophet (ﷺ) gestured to him to stay where he was. Then (the two men) brought him to sit beside Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr was following the lead of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the people were following Abu Bakr.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":430},"chapter":{"id":142,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي صَلاَةِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ فِي مَرَضِهِ","eng-name":"What has been narrated concerning the Prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during his sickness","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
