The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to the mosque and stood and said the Takbir, and the people formed rows behind him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) recited for a long time, then he said the Takbir and bowed for a long time. Then he raised his head and said: ‘Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, Rabban was lakal-hamd.’ Then he stood and recited for a long time, but shorter than the first recitation. Then he said the Takbir and bowed for a long time, but less than the first bowing. Then he said: ‘Sami’ Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd.’ Then he did the same in the next Rak’ah, and he completed four Rak’ah and four sets of prostration, and the eclipse ended before he finished. Then he stood and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He deserves to be praised, then he said: ‘The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. If you see that then seek help in prayer.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Bukhari And Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":461},"chapter":{"id":152,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي صَلاَةِ الْكُسُوفِ","eng-name":"What was narrated concerning the eclipse Prayer","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
