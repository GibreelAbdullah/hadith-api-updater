Glory is to Allah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Praise is to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. O Allah, I ask You for the means of Your mercy and forgiveness, the benefit of every good deed and safety from all sins. I ask You not to leave any sin of mine but You forgive it, or any distress but You relieve it, or any need that is pleasing to You but You meet it). Then he should ask Allah for whatever he wants in this world and in the Hereafter, for it is decreed.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Very Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":582},"chapter":{"id":189,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي صَلاَةِ الْحَاجَةِ","eng-name":"What was narrated concerning Prayer at times of need","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
