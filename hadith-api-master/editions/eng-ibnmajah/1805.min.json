If there is more than that - even one - then two sheep, up to two hundred, If there is one more than that - even one = then three sheep, up to three hundred. If there are many sheep, then for each hundred, one sheep.' And I read in it: 'Separate flocks should not be combined, and a combined flock should not be separated.'
