But he did not give any of his wives and none of his daughters were given more than twelve uqiyyah. A man may increase dowry until he feels resentment against her and says: “You cost me everything I own,” or, “You caused me a great deal of hardship.”'” (Hassan)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih Lighairihi"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":43},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب صَدَاقِ النِّسَاءِ","eng-name":"Dowries of women","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
