I went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), there has come to me news of my husband's death and I am in a house far away from the house of my people and the house of my brothers. He did not leave any money that could be spent on me, or any inheritance, or any house I may take possession of. If you think that you could give me permission to join my family and my brothers, then that is what I prefer and is better for me in some ways.' He said: 'Do that if you wish.' Then I went out, feeling happy with the ruling of Allah given upon the lips of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), until, when I was in the mosque, or, in one of the apartments, he called me and said: 'What did you say?' I told him the story, and he said: 'Stay in the house in which the news of your husband's death came to you, until your waiting period is ever.\"' She said: \"So I observed the waiting period there for four months and ten (days)","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":16},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب أَيْنَ تَعْتَدُّ الْمُتَوَفَّى عَنْهَا زَوْجُهَا","eng-name":"Where should the woman whose husband died observe her waiting period?","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
