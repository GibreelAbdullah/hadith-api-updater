Aqra' bin Habis, who was the chief of Khindaf, came to him arguing in defense of Muhallim bin Jaththamah. Uyainah bin Hisn came to him demanding vengeance for 'Amir bin Adbat who was from the tribe of Ashja. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to them: “Will you accept the blood money?'” But they refused. Then a man from Banu Laith, whose name was Mukaital, stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)! By Allah (SWT)! This man who was killed in the early days of Islam is like Sheep that come to drink but stones are thrown at them, so the last of them runs away (i.e. ,the murderer should be killed).' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'You will have fifty (camels) while we are traveling and fifty (camels) when we return.' So they accepted the blood money.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":11},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ قَتَلَ عَمْدًا فَرَضُوا بِالدِّيَةِ","eng-name":"One Who Is Killed Deliberately And His Heirs Accept The Blood Money.","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
