The one who is killed by mistake is the one who is killed with a whip or a stick; for him the blood money is one hundred camels, of which forty should be pregnant she-camels with their youngs in their wombs. Every custom of Ignorance period, and every blood claim, is beneath these two feet of mine (i.e. is abolished), except for the custodianship of the Ka'bah and the provision of water for the pilgrims, which I confirm still belong to the people to whom they belonged before.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":14},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب دِيَةِ شِبْهِ الْعَمْدِ مُغَلَّظَةً","eng-name":"The Blood Money For What Appears To Be Intentional Due To Its Harshness.","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
