They offered to pay compensatory money, but they refused. So they came to Prophet (ﷺ) who ordered retaliation. Anas bin Nadr said: 'O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), will the tooth of Rubai' be broken? By the One Who sent you with the truth, it will not be broken!' The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'O Anas, what Allah has decreed is retaliation.' So the people accepted that and forgave her. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'there are among the slaves of Allah those who, if they swear by Allah, Allah fulfills their oath.'”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":35},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب الْقِصَاصِ فِي السِّنِّ","eng-name":"The Retaliation For A Tooth","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
