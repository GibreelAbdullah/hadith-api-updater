He said:Bismillah, then he took a morsel and ate it, then a second. Then he said: “I notice some fat in the food but it is not the fat of the meat.” ‘Abdullah said: “O Commander of the Believers! I went out to the marketplace looking for some fatty meat (bones with plenty of meat on them) to buy, but it was expensive, so I bought some lean meat (bones with not much meat on them) for a Dirham, and added a Dirham’s worth of ghee. I wanted my family to go through it bone by bone.” ‘Umar said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never had these two things together; he would eat one and give the other in charity.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":111},"chapter":{"id":57,"ara-name":"باب الْجَمْعِ بَيْنَ السَّمْنِ وَاللَّحْمِ","eng-name":"Ghee and meat together","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
