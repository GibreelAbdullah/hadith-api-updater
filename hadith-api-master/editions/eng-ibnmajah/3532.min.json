A woman from Khath’am followed him, and with her was a son of hers who had been afflicted, he could not speak. She said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! This is my son, and he is all I have left of my family. He has been afflicted and cannot speak.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Bring me some water.’ So it was brought, and he washed his hands and rinsed out his mouth. Then he gave it to her and said: ‘Give him some to drink, and pour some over him, and seek Allah’s healing for him.’” She (Umm Jundub) said: “I met that woman and said: ‘Why don’t you give me some?’ She said: ‘It is only for the sick one.’ I met that woman one year later and asked her about the boy. She said: ‘He recovered and became (very) smart, not like the rest of the people.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":97},"chapter":{"id":40,"ara-name":"باب النُّشْرَةِ","eng-name":"An-Nushrah","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
