He said: ‘I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: “The Romans will enter into a peace treaty with you, then you and they will fight one another as enemies, and you will be victorious; you will collect the spoils of war and be safe. Then you will come back until you stop in a meadow with many hillocks. A man from among the people of the Cross will raise the Cross and will say: ‘The Cross has prevailed.’ Then a man among the Muslims will become angry and will go and break the Cross. Then the Romans will prove treacherous (breaking the treaty) (and will gather) for the fierce battle.”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":164},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"باب الْمَلاَحِمِ ","eng-name":"The fierce battles","isFirstHadith":true}},{"hadithnumber":4089.2,"arabicnumber":4089.2,"text":"Another chain with a similar report to which he added:\"They will gather for the fierce battle, and at that time they will come with eighty banners, under each of which will be twelve thousand troops","grades":[],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":165},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"باب الْمَلاَحِمِ ","eng-name":"The fierce battles","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
