Abu Hashim wept and Mu’awiyah said to him: ‘Why are you weeping, O maternal uncle? Is there some pain bothering you, or is it because of this world, the best of which has already passed?’ He said: ‘It is not for any of these reasons. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave me some advice and I wish that I had followed it. He (ﷺ) said: “There may come a time when you will see wealth divided among the people, and all you will need of that is a servant and a mount to ride in the cause of Allah.” That time came, but I accumulated wealth.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":4},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب الزُّهْدِ فِي الدُّنْيَا .","eng-name":"Indifference towards this world","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
