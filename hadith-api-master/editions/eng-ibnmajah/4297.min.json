He passed by some people and said: ‘Who are these people?’ They said: ‘We are Muslims.’ There was a woman putting wood in her oven, and a son of hers was with her. When the flames got higher, she moved him away. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘Are you the Messenger of Allah?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘May my father and mother be ransomed for you. Is not Allah the Most Merciful of those who show mercy?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘Is not Allah more Merciful than a mother to her child?’ He said: ‘Yes indeed.’ She said: ‘A mother would not throw her child into the fire.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) lowered his head and wept. Then he looked up at her and said: ‘Allah does not punish any of His slaves except those who are defiant and rebellious, who rebel against Allah and refuse to say: La ilaha illallah.’”","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Muhammad Fouad Abd al-Baqi","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Shuaib Al Arnaut","grade":"Mawdu"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":198},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُرْجَى مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ","eng-name":"What is hoped of the Mercy of Allah on the Day of Resurrection","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
