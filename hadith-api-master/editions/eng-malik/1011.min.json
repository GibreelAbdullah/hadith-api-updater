A man said, 'Shall I give you this small cucumber?' and he had a small cucumber in his hand and you will say, 'I must walk to the house of Allah?' I said, 'Yes' and I said it, for at that time I was still immature. Then, when I came of age, some one said to me that I had to fulfill my vow. I went and asked Said ibn al- Musayyab about it, and he said to me, 'You must walk.' So I walked.\" Malik said, \"That is the custom among us","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Daif"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":3},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":false}}]}
