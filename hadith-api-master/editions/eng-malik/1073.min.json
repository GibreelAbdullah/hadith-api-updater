Malik said, \"What we do about the aqiqa is that if someone makes an aqiqa for his children, he gives a sheep for both male and female. The aqiqa is not obligatory but it is desirable to do it, and people continue to come to us about it. If someone makes an aqiqa for his children, the same rules apply as with all sacrificial animals - one-eyed, emaciated, injured, or sick animals must not be used, and neither the meat or the skin is to be sold. The bones are broken and the family eat the meat and give some of it away as sadaqa. The child is not smeared with any of the blood","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":7},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":false}}]}
