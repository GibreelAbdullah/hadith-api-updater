They married her to him and her people found fault with Abd ar-Rahman and said, \"We only gave in marriage because of A'isha.\" A'isha therefore sent for Abd ar-Rahman and told him about it. He gave Qurayba authority over herself and she chose her husband and so there was no divorce","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":14},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":true}}]}
