Malik was asked whether a man who had women and slavegirlscould have intercourse with all of them before he did ghusl. He said, \"There is no harm in a man having intercourse with two of his slave girls before he does ghusl. It is disapproved of, however, to go to a freewoman on another's day. There is no harm in making love first to one slave girl and then to another when one is junub.\" Malik was asked about a man who was junub and water was put down for him to do ghusl with.Then he forgot and put his finger into it to find out whether it was hot or cold. Malik said, \"If no filth has soiled his fingers, I do not consider that that makes the water impure","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":88},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":false}}]}
