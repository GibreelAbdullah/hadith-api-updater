The pledge is superior to that for which he pawned it. The pledger says to the pawn-broker, 'I will bring you your due, after such-and-such a time. If not, the pledge is yours for what it was pawned for.' \" Malik said, \"This transaction is not good and it is not halal. This is what was forbidden. If the owner brings what he pledged it for after the period, it is his. I think that the time condition is void","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":16},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":true}}]}
