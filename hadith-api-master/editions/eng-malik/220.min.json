The sight was pleasing to him and he let his eyes follow the bird for a time and then he went back to his prayer but could not remember how much he had prayed. He said, \"A trial has befallen me in this property of mine.\" So he came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and mentioned the trial that had happened to him in his garden and said, \"Messenger of Allah, it is a sadaqa for Allah, so dispose of it wherever you wish","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":53},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":false}}]}
