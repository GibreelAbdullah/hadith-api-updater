But if he arrives when the time has past, he should do the travelling prayer. That way he only repays what he owes.\" Malik said, \"This is what I have found the people and men of knowledge doing in our community.\" Malik explained that shafaq was the redness in the sky after the sun had set, and said, \"When the redness has gone then the isha prayer is due and you have left the time of maghrib","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Maqtu Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":23},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":false}}]}
