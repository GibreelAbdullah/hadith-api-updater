Some men were praying by themselves, whilst others were praying in small groups. Umar said, 'By Allah! It would be better in my opinion if these people gathered behind one reciter.' So he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn Kab. Then I went out with him another night and the people were praying behind their Qur'an reciter. Umar said, 'How excellent this new way is, but what you miss while you are asleep is better than what you watch in prayer.' He meant the end of the night, and people used to watch the beginning of the night in prayer","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Mauquf Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":3},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":true}}]}
