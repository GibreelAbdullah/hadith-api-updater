The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Return my cloak to me. Are you afraid that I will not distribute among you what Allah has given you as spoils. By He in whose hand my self is! Had Allah given you spoils equal to the number of acacia trees on the plain of Tihama, I would have distributed it among you. You will not find me to be miserly, cowardly, or a liar.\" Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got down and stood among the people, and said, \"Hand over even the needle and thread, for stealing from the spoils is disgrace, fire, ignominy on the Day of Rising for people who do it.\" Then he took a bit of camel fluff or something from the ground and said, \"By He in whose hand my self is! What Allah has made spoils for you is not mine - even the like of this! - except for the tax of one fifth, and the tax of one fifth is returned to you","grades":[{"name":"Salim al-Hilali","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":22},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng-name":null,"isFirstHadith":true}}]}
