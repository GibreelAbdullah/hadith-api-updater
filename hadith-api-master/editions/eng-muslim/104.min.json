He (the narrator) said:The Prophet (ﷺ) stopped for a while and cast a glance upon his companions and then said: He was afforded a good opportunity (or he had been guided well). He (the Holy Prophet) addressing the bedouin said: (Repeat) whatever you have uttered. He (the bedouin) repeated that. Upon this the Apostle (ﷺ) remarked: The deed which can draw you near to Paradise and take you away from Hell is, that you worship Allah and associate none with Him, and you establish prayer and pay Zakat, and do good to your kin. After having uttered these words, the Prophet asked the bedouin to release the nosestring of his she-camel","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":12},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ الإِيمَانِ الَّذِي يُدْخَلُ بِهِ الْجَنَّةُ وَأَنَّ مَنْ تَمَسَّكَ بِمَا أُمِرَ بِهِ دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ","eng-name":"Explaining the faith by means of which a person is admitted into paradise, and that the one who adheres to what is enjoined upon him will enter paradise","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
