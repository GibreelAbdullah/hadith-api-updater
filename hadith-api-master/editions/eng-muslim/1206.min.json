I came to him and he was engaged in prayer on the back of his camel. I talked to him and he gestured to me With his hand, and Zuhair gestured with his hand. I then again talked and he again (gestured to me with his hand). Zuhair pointed with his hand towards the ground. I heard him (the Holy Prophet) reciting the Qur'an and making a sign with his head. When he com- pleted the prayer he sa'id: What have you done (with regard to that business) for which I sent you? I could not talk with you but for the fact that I was engaged in prayer. Zuhair told that Abu Zubair was sitting with his face turned towards Qibla (as he transmitted this hadith). Abu Zuhair pointed towards Banu Mustaliq with his hand and the direction to which he pointed with his hand was not towards the Ka'ba","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":46},"chapter":{"id":7,"ara-name":"باب تَحْرِيمِ الْكَلاَمِ فِي الصَّلاَةِ وَنَسْخِ مَا كَانَ مِنْ إِبَاحَتِهِ ","eng-name":"The prohibition of speaking during the prayer, and the abrogation of its former permissibility","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
