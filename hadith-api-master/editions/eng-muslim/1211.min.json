When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand. He replied: Allah's enemy Iblis came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times:\" I Seek refuge in Allah from thee.\" Then I said three times:\" I curse thee with Allah's full curse.\" But he did not retreat (on any one of these) three occasions. Thereafter I meant to seize him. I swear by Allah that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Sulaiman he would have been bound, and made an object of sport for the children of Medina","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":51},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب جَوَازِ لَعْنِ الشَّيْطَانِ فِي أَثْنَاءِ الصَّلاَةِ وَالتَّعَوُّذِ مِنْهُ وَجَوَازِ الْعَمَلِ الْقَلِيلِ فِي الصَّلاَةِ","eng-name":"The permissibility of cursing the Shaitan during prayer, and seeking refuge with Allah from him; and the permissibility of doing a few actions while in salat","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
