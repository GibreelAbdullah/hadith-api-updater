'Umar b. Khattab said to Abu Bakr:Why would you fight against the people, when the Messenger of Allah declared: I have been directed to fight against people so long as they do not say: There is no god but Allah, and he who professed it was granted full protection of his property and life on my behalf except for a right? His (other) affairs rest with Allah. Upon this Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I would definitely fight against him who severed prayer from Zakat, for it is the obligation upon the rich. By Allah, I would fight against them even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it. Umar b. Khattab remarked: By Allah, I found nothing but the fact that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr for (perceiving the justification of) fighting (against those who refused to pay Zakat) and I fully recognized that the (stand of Abu Bakr) was right","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":32},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب الأَمْرِ بِقِتَالِ النَّاسِ حَتَّى يَقُولُوا لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ويقيموا الصلاة ويؤتوا الزكاة ويؤمنوا بجميع ما جاء به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وأن من فعل ذلك عصم نفسه وماله إلا بحقها ووكلت سريرته إلى الله تعالى وقتال من منع الزكاة أو غيرها من حقوق الإسلام واهتمام الإمام بشعائر الإسلام","eng-name":"The command to fight the people until they say \"La ilaha illallah Muhammad Rasul-Allah\", and establish Salat, and pay the Zakat, and believe in everything that the prophet (ﷺ) brought.
