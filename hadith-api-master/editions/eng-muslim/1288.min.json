Abu Bakr and `Umar were among the people and they were too afraid to speak to him and the people came out in haste (saying): The prayer has been shortened. But among them was a man called Dhul-Yadain who said: Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or have you forgotten?

He offered two (more) rak`ahs and gave salutation, then said takbir and prostrated and lifted (his head) and then said takbir and prostrated, then said takbir and lifted (his head).
