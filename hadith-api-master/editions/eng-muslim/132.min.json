Hisham) and 'Abdullah b. Abi Umayya ibn al-Mughirah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no god but Allah, and I will bear testimony before Allah (of your being a believer), Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah b. Abi Umayya addressing him said: Abu Talib, would you abandon the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) constantly requested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same statement (of Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah b. Abi Umayya) till Abu Talib gave his final decision and be stuck to the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that there is no god but Allah. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: By Allah, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so (by God), It was then that Allah, the Magnificent and the Glorious, revealed this verse: \" It is not meet for the Prophet and for those who believe that they should beg pardon for the polytheists, even though they were their kith and kin, after it had been made known to them that they were the denizens of Hell\" (ix. 113) And it was said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): \" Verily thou canst not guide to the right path whom thou lovest. And it is Allah Who guideth whom He will, and He knoweth best who are the guided\" (xxviii)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":39},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب الدليل على صحة إسلام من حضره الموت ما لم يشرع في النزع وهو الغرغرة ونسخ جواز الاستغفار للمشركين والدليل على أن من مات على الشرك فهو في أصحاب الجحيم ولا ينقذه من ذلك شيء من الوسائل","eng-name":"Evidence that the islam of one who becomes muslim on his deathbed is valid, so long as the death thoes have not begun; Abrogation of permission to supplicate for forgiveness for the idolators; Evidence that one who dies an idolator is one of the people of hell and no intervention can save him from that","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
