Mas'ud) reported:He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow as Muslim, he should persevere in observing these prayers, when a call is announced for them, for Allah has laid down for your Prophet the paths of right guidance, and these (prayers) are among the paths of right guidance. If you were to pray in your houses as this man why stays away (from the mosque) prays in his house, you would abandon the practice of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the practice of your Prophet, you would go astray. No man purifies himself, doing it well, then makes for one of those mosques without Allah recording a blessing for him for every step he takes raising him a degree for it, and effacing a sin from him for it. I have seen the time when no one stayed away from it, except a hypocrite, who was well known for his hypocrisy, whereas a man would be brought swaying (due to weakness) between two men till he was set up in a row","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":321},"chapter":{"id":44,"ara-name":"باب صَلاَةُ الْجَمَاعَةِ مِنْ سُنَنِ الْهُدَى ","eng-name":"Prayer in congregation is one of the sunnah of guidance","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
