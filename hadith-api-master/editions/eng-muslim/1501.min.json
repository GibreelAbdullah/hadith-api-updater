He (the Holy Prophet) said: Stand up so that I may lead you in prayer (and there was no time for prescribed prayer). He led us in prayer. A person said to Thabit: Where stood Anas with him (the Holy Prophet)? He replied: He was on the right side. He then blessed us, the members of the household with every good of this world and of the Hereafter. My mother said: Messenger of Allah (and then, pointing towards Anas, said), here is your little servant, invoke the blessing of Allah upon him too. He then blessed me with every good, and he concluded his blessings for me (with these words): Allah! increase his wealth, and his children and make (them the source of) blessing for him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":334},"chapter":{"id":48,"ara-name":"باب جَوَازِ الْجَمَاعَةِ فِي النَّافِلَةِ وَالصَّلاَةِ عَلَى حَصِيرٍ وَخُمْرَةٍ وَثَوْبٍ وَغَيْرِهَا مِنَ الطَّاهِرَاتِ","eng-name":"It is permissible to offer voluntary prayers in congregation, and to pray on hasir (palm-fiber mats), khumrah (small mats), cloth, and other pure things","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
