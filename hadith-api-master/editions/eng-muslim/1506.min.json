He does not take a step without being raised a degree for it and having a sin remitted for it, till he enters the mosque, and when he is busy in prayer after having entered the mosque. the angels continue to invoke blessing on him as long as he is in his place of worship. saying: O Allah, show him mercy, and pardon him! Accept his repentance (and the angels continue this supplication for him) so long as he does not do any harm in it, or as long as his ablution is not broken","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":5,"hadith":339},"chapter":{"id":49,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ صَلاَةِ الْجَمَاعَةِ وَانْتِظَارِ الصَّلاَةِ ","eng-name":"The virtue of offering the obligatory prayers in congregation, the virtue of waiting for prayer and taking many steps towards the masjid, the virtue of walking to the masjid","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
