Abd al-Rahman asked 'A'isha about the (night) prayer of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) during the month of Ramadan. She said:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not observe either in Ramadan or in other months more than eleven rak'ahs (of the night prayer). He (in the first instance) observed four rak'ahs. Ask not about their excellence and their length (i. e. these were matchless in perfection and length). He again observed four rak'ahs, and ask not about their excellence and their length. He would then observe three rak'ahs (of the Witr prayer). 'A'isha again said: I said: Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before observing the Witr prayer? He said: O 'A'isha, my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":152},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب صَلاَةِ اللَّيْلِ وَعَدَدِ رَكَعَاتِ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فِي اللَّيْلِ وَأَنَّ الْوِتْرَ رَكْعَةٌ وَأَنَّ الرَّكْعَةَ صَلاَةٌ صَحِيحَةٌ","eng-name":"Night prayers and the number of rak`ah offered by the Prophet (ﷺ) at night, and that Witr is one rak`ah, and a one-rak`ah prayer is correct","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
