Mas'ud after we had observed the dawn prayer and we paid salutation at the door. He permitted us to enter, but we stayed for a while at the door, when the slave-girl came out and said: Why don't you come in? So we went in and (we found 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud) sitting and glorifying Allah (i. e. he was busy in dhikr) and he said: What obstructed you from coming in though you had been granted permission for it? We said: There was nothing (behind it) but we entertained the idea that some inmate of the house might be sleeping. He said: Do you presume any idleness on the part of the family of Ibn Umm 'Abd (the mother of Abdullah b. Mas'ud)? He was again busy with the glorification of Allah till he thought that the sun had risen. He said: Girl, see whether (the sun) has arisen. She glanced but it had not risen (by that time). He was again busy with the glorification (of Allah) and he (again) thought that the sun had arisen. She glanced (and confirmed) that, it had risen. Upon this he ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) said: Praise be to Allah Who did not call us to account for our sins today. Mahdi said: I think that he said, He did not destroy us for our sins. One among the people said: I recited all the mufassal surahs during the night. 'Abdullah said: (You must have recited them) like the (recitation) of poetry. I heard (the Holy Prophet) combining (the sarahs) and I remember the combinations which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made In the recitation (of surahs). These were constituted of eighteen mufassal surahs and two surahs (commencing with) Ha-Mim","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":6,"hadith":339},"chapter":{"id":49,"ara-name":"باب تَرْتِيلِ الْقِرَاءَةِ وَاجْتِنَابِ الْهَذِّ وَهُوَ الإِفْرَاطُ فِي السُّرْعَةِ وَإِبَاحَةِ سُورَتَيْنِ فَأَكْثَرَ فِي الرَّكْعَةِ","eng-name":"Slow, measured pace of recitation (tartil), and to not rush when reciting, and the permissibility of reciting two or more surahs in one rak`ah","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
