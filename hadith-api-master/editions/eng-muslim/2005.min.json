And the most evil affairs are their innovations; and every innovation is error.\" He would further say:, I am more dear to a Muslim even than his self; and he who left behind property that is for his family; and he who dies under debt or leaves children (in helplessness), the responsibility (of paying his debt and bringing up his children) lies on me","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":7,"hadith":55},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب تَخْفِيفِ الصَّلاَةِ وَالْخُطْبَةِ ","eng-name":"Keeping the prayer and khutbah short","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
