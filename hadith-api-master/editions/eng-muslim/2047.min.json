'Abdullah reported:The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) stood up on the day of 'Id al-Fitr and observed prayer. And he commenced the prayer before the sermon. He then delivered the sermon. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had finished (the sermon) he came down from (the pulpit), and made his way to the women and exhorted them (to do good acts), and he was leaning on the hand of Bilal. Bilal had stretched his cloth in which women were throwing alms. I (one of the narrators) said to 'Ata' (the other narrator): It must be Zakat on the day of Fitr. He ('Ata') said: No. It was alms (which) they were giving on that occasion, and a woman gave her ring, and then others gave, and then others gave. I said to 'Ata': Is It right now for the Imam to come to the women when he has finished (his address to the men) that he should exhort them (to good deeds)? He said: (Why not) by my life, it is right for them (to do so). What is the matter with them that they do not do it now?","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":8,"hadith":3},"chapter":{"id":0,"ara-name":"باب { ...}","eng-name":"","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
