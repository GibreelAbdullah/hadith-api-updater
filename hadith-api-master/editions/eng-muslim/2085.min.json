I ask Thee for what is good in it, and the good which it contains, and the good of that which it was sent for. I seek refuge with Thee from what is evil in it, what evil it contains, and the evil of that what it was sent for; and when there was a thunder and lightning in the sky, his colour underwent a change, and he went out and in, backwards and forwards; and when the rain came, he felt relieved, and I noticed that (the sign of relief) on his face. 'A'isha asked him (about it) and he said: It may be as the people of 'Ad said: When they saw a cloud formation coming to their valley they said:\" It is a cloud which would give us rain\" (Qur'an, xlvi)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":9,"hadith":16},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب التَّعَوُّذِ عِنْدَ رُؤْيَةِ الرِّيحِ وَالْغَيْمِ وَالْفَرَحِ بِالْمَطَرِ ","eng-name":"Seeking Refuge With Allah When Seeing Wind And Dark Clouds, And Rejoicing At The Rain","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
