He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and landed Him and said:The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyones death or on account of anyone's birth.
