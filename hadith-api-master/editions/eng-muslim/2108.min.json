After this I satisfied my need and then came and entered the mosque. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) standing in prayer. I stood along with him. He prolonged his qiyam till I wished to sit down. Then I cast a glance towards an old woman. So I said: She is older than I. I, therefore, kept standing. He (the Holy Prophet) then observed ruku', and prolonged his ruku'. He then raised his head. He then prolonged his qiyam to such an extent that if a person happened to come he would have thought that he had not observed the ruku","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":10,"hadith":17},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب مَا عُرِضَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي صَلاَةِ الْكُسُوفِ مِنْ أَمْرِ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ","eng-name":"What Was Shown To The Prophet (ﷺ) Of Paradise And Hell During The Eclipse Prayer","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
