Upon this she said:He (Ibn 'Umar) missed (the point). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had (in fact) said: He (the dead) is punished for his faults or for his sins, and the members of his family are wailing for him now. (This misunderstanding of Ibn 'Umar is similar to his saying: ) The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those polytheists who had been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to say, i. e.: They hear what I say. But he (Ibn 'Umar) misunderstood. The Prophet (ﷺ) had only said: They (the dead) understand that what I used to say to them was truth. She then recited:\" Certainly, thou canst not make the dead hear the call\" (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the graves, nor can you inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":32},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب الْمَيِّتُ يُعَذَّبُ بِبُكَاءِ أَهْلِهِ عَلَيْهِ ","eng-name":"The deceased is tormented because of his family's crying for him","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
