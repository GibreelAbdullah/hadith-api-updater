Abu Talib and Abdullah b. Rawaha were killed, he sat down, showing signs of grief. She (further) said:I was looking (at him) through the crevice of the door. A man came to him and mentioned that Ja'far's women were lamenting. He (the Holy Prophet) commanded him to go and forbid them (to do so). So he went away but came back and told (him) that they did not obey (him). He commanded him a second time to go and forbid them (to do so). He again went but came back to him and said: I swear by God, Messenger of Allah, that they have overpowered us. She ('A'isha) said that she thought the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told (her) to throw dust in their mouths. Thereupon 'A'isha said: May Allah humble you! You did not do what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered you, nor did you stop annoying Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":39},"chapter":{"id":10,"ara-name":"باب التَّشْدِيدِ فِي النِّيَاحَةِ","eng-name":"Stern warning against wailing","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
