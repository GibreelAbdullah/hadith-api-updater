'Amir b. Sa'd b. Abu Waqqas reported on the authority of his father that while he was sitting along with 'Abdullah b. 'Umar, Khabbab, the owner of Maqsura, said:Ibn 'Umar, do you hear what Abu Huraira says that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:\" He who goes out with the bier when taken out from its residence and offers prayer for it and he then follows it till it is buried, he would have two qirats of reward, each qirat being equivalent to Uhud; and he who, after having offered prayer, (directly) came back would have his reward (as great) as Uhud\"? Ibn 'Umar sent Khabbab to 'A'isha in order to ask her about the words of Abu Huraira (and also told him) to come back to him (Ibn 'Umar) and inform him what 'A'isha said. (In the meanwhile) Ibn 'Umar took up a handful of pebbles and turned them over in his hand till the messenger (Khabbab) came back to him and told (him) that 'A'isha testified (the statement of) Abu Huraira. Ibn 'Umar threw the pebbles he had in his hand on the ground and then said: We missed a large number of qirats","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":11,"hadith":73},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ الصَّلاَةِ عَلَى الْجَنَازَةِ وَاتِّبَاعِهَا ","eng-name":"The virtue of offering the funeral prayer and following the bier","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
