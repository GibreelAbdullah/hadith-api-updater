Abdullah reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as saying:No owner of camels or cattle or flock of sheep or goats who does not pay his due (would be spared punishment) but would be made to sit on the Day of Resurrection on a soft sandy ground and the hoofed animals would trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. And none of them on that day would be without horns, or with broken horns. We said: Messenger of Allah, but what is due on them? He said: Lending of the male (for use) and lending of the bucket (used for drawing water for them) and for mating and milking them near water and providing them as a ride for the sake of Allah. And no owner of the property who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but it (his property) would turn into a bald snake and would follow its owner wherever he would go, and he would run away from it, and it would be said to him: That is your property about which you were stingy. And when he would find no other way out he would thrust his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a male camel","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب إِثْمِ مَانِعِ الزَّكَاةِ ","eng-name":"The sin of one who withholds Zakat","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
