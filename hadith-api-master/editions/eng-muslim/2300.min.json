As he saw me he said: By the Lord of the Ka'ba, they are the losers. I came there till I sat and I could not stay (longer) and (then) stood up. I said: Messenger of Allah, let my father, be ransom for you, who are they (the losers)? He said: They are those having a huge amount of wealth except so and so and (those who spend their wealth generously on them whom they find in front of them, behind them and on their right side and on their left side) and they are a few. And no owner of camels, or cattle or goat and sheep, who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment) but these (camels, cattle, goats and sheep) would come on the Day of Resurrection wearing more flesh and would gore him with their horns and trample them with their hooves. And when the last one would pass away, the first one would return (to trample him) till judgment would be pronounced among people","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":37},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب تَغْلِيظِ عُقُوبَةِ مَنْ لاَ يُؤَدِّي الزَّكَاةَ ","eng-name":"Severe Punishment for the one who does not pay Zakat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
