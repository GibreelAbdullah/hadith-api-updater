Mas'ud ), reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:0 women, give sadaqa even though it be some of your jewellery. She returned to 'Abdullah and said: You are a person with empty hands, whereas the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has commanded us to give sadaqa, so better go to him and ask and if this will suffice for me; otherwise I shall give it to someone else. 'Abdullah said to me (his wife): You better go yourself. So I went and there was another woman of the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) having the same porpose as I had. Now Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was invested with awe (so we did not like to knock). Then Bilal came out and we said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and inform him that there are two women at the door asking him whether it will serve them to give sadaqa to their spouses and to orphans who are under their charge, but do not inform him who we are. Bilal went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him (what these women had instructed him to ask). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him who these women were. He (Bilal) said: They are women from Ansar and Zainab. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Which of the Zainabs? He said: The wife of 'Abdullah. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There are two rewards for them, the reward of kinship and the reward of Sadaqa","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":55},"chapter":{"id":14,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ النَّفَقَةِ وَالصَّدَقَةِ عَلَى الْأَقْرَبِينَ وَالزَّوْجِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ وَالْوَالِدَيْنِ وَلَوْ كَانُوا مُشْرِكِينَ","eng-name":"The virtue of spending and giving charity to relatives, spuses, children and parents, even if they are idolaters","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
