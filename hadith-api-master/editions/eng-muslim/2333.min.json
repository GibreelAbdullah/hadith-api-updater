Abu Burda reported on the authority of his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:Giving of Sadaqa is essential for every Muslim. It was said (to him): What do you say of him who does not find (the means) to do so? He said: Let him work with both his hands, thus doing benefit to himself and give Sadaqa. It was said to him: What about him who does not have (the means) to do so? He said: Then let him assist the needy, the aggrieved. It was said: What do you say of one who cannot even do this? He said: Then he should enjoin what is reputable or what is good. He said: What about him if he cannot do that? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He should then abstain from evil, for verify that is Sadaqa on his behalf","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":70},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ أَنَّ اسْمَ الصَّدَقَةِ يَقَعُ عَلَى كُلِّ نَوْعٍ مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ ","eng-name":"The word charity (Sadaqah) may apply to all good deeds Ma'ruf","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
