And Allah commanded the believers as He commanded the Messengers by saying: \"O Messengers, eat of the good things, and do good deeds; verily I am aware of what you do\" (xxiii. 51). And He said: \"O those who believe, eat of the good things that We gave you\" (ii. 172). He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":83},"chapter":{"id":19,"ara-name":"باب قَبُولِ الصَّدَقَةِ مِنَ الْكَسْبِ الطَّيِّبِ وَتَرْبِيَتِهَا ","eng-name":"Acceptance of charity that comes from good (Tayyib) earnings, and the growth thereof","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
