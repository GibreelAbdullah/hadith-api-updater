In the morning, the people were talking and saying: charity was given to an adulteress last night. He (the giver of Sadaqa) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to an adulteress. He then again expressed his intention to give charity; so he went out with the charity and placed it in the hand of a rich person. In the morning the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a rich person. He (the giver of charity) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise-to a well-to-do person. He then expressed his intention to give charity, so he went out with charity and placed it in the hand of a thief. In the morning, the people were talking and saying: Charity was given to a thief. So (one of the persons) said: 0 Allah, to Thee be the praise (what a misfortune it is that charity has been given to) the adulteress, to a rich person. to a thief! There came (the angel to him) and he was told: Your charity has been accepted. As for the adulteress (the charity might become the means) whereby she might restrain herself from fornication. The rich man might perhaps learn a lesson and spend from what Allah has given him, and the thief might thereby refrain from committing theft","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":99},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب ثُبُوتِ أَجْرِ الْمُتَصَدِّقِ وَإِنْ وَقَعَتِ الصَّدَقَةُ فِي يَدِ غَيْرِ أَهْلِهَا ","eng-name":"Confirmation of the reward of the one who gives Charity, even if the Charity ends up in the hands of an evildoer, and the like","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
