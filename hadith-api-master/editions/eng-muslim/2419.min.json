Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur'an and he said:You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:\" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust.\" And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:\" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise\" (lxi 2.) and\" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection\" (xvii)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":156},"chapter":{"id":39,"ara-name":"باب لَوْ أَنَّ لاِبْنِ آدَمَ وَادِيَيْنِ لاَبْتَغَى ثَالِثًا ","eng-name":"If the Son of Adam had two valleys, he would desire a third","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
