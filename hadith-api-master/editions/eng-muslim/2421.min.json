A person said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) remained silent for a while and he then said: What did you say? He replied: Messenger of Allah, I said: Does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him: The good does not produce but good. but among the plants the spring rain produces There some which kill with a tremour or nearly kill all but the animal which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the can. then when it has donged or urinated and chewed it returns and eats. He who accepts wealth rightly, Allah confers blessing on it for him. and he who takes wealth without any right, he is like one who eats and is not satisfied","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":158},"chapter":{"id":41,"ara-name":"باب تَخَوُّفِ مَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا ","eng-name":"Warning against being deceived by the splendor and luxury of this world","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
