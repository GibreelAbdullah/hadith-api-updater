They (the Prophet's Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, what is the adornment of the world? He said: Blessings (the natural resources) of the earth. They (again) said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? He said: No, only good comes out of good. No, only good comes out of good. No. only good comes out of good. All that which the spring rain helps to grow kills or is about to kill but (the animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the sun, it chews the cud, it has dunged and urinated. it returns and eats. This wealth is green and sweet, and he who accepts it and applies it rightly, finds it a good help, but he who takes it wrongfully is like one who eats without being satisfied","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":12,"hadith":159},"chapter":{"id":41,"ara-name":"باب تَخَوُّفِ مَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا ","eng-name":"Warning against being deceived by the splendor and luxury of this world","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
