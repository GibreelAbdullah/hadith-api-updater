I (Fadl) arrived in Syria, and did the needful for her. It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month. Abdullah b. 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said:When did you see it? I said: We saw it on the night of Friday. He said: (Did) you see it yourself? I said: Yes, and the people also saw it and they fasted and Mu'awiya also fasted, whereupon he said: But we saw it on Saturday night. So we will continue to fast till we complete thirty (fasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal). I said: Is the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiya not valid for you? He said: No; this is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has commanded us. Yahya b. Yahya was in doubt (whether the word used in the narration by Kuraib) was Naktafi or Taktafi","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ أَنَّ لِكُلِّ بَلَدٍ رُؤْيَتَهُمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِذَا رَأَوْا الْهِلَالَ بِبَلَدٍ لَا يَثْبُتُ حُكْمُهُ لِمَا بَعُدَ عَنْهُمْ","eng-name":"Each land has its own sighting of the moon, and if they see the crescent in one land, that does not necessarily apply to regions that are far away from it","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
