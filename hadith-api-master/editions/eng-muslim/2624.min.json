I ask you about fasting on a journey. Upon this he said: We travelled with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) towards Mecca and we had been observing fast. We halted at a place. There the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You are nearing your enemy and breaking of fast would give you greater strength, and that was a concession (given to us). But some of us continued to observe the fast and some of us broke it. We then got down at another place and he (the Holy Prophet) said: You are going to encounter the enemy in the morning and breaking of the fast would give you strength, so break the fast. As it was a point of stress, so we broke the fast. But subsequently we saw ourselves observing the fast with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on a journey","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":130},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب أَجْرِ الْمُفْطِرِ فِي السَّفَرِ إِذَا تَوَلَّى الْعَمَلَ ","eng-name":"The reward of the one who does not fast when travelling if he does any tasks that are required","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
