She said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out, and there was a present, for us and (at the same time) some visitors dropped in. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back, I said to him: Messenger of Allah, a present was given to us, (and in the meanwhile) there came to us visitors (a major Portion of it has been spent on them), but I have saved something for you. He said: What is it? I said: It is hais (a compound of dates and clarified butter). He said: Bring that. So I brought it to him and he ate it and then said: I woke up in the morning observing fast.
