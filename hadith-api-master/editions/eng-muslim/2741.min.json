Amr, and he narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was informed about my fasting and he came to me, and I placed a leather cushion filled with fibre of date-palms for him. He sat down upon the ground and there was that cushion between me and him, and he said to me: Does three days' fasting in a month not suffice you? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He said: (Would) five (not suffice for you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts) He said: (Would) seven (fasts) not suffice you? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He (the Holy Prophet) then said: (Would) nine (fasts not suffice you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts). He said: (Would) eleven (fasts not suffice you)? I said: Messenger of Allah, (I am capable of observing more fasts than these). Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: There is no fasting (better than) the fasting of David which comprises half of the age, fasting a day and not fasting a day","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":247},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"بَاب النَّهْيِ عَنْ صَوْمِ الدَّهْرِ لِمَنْ تَضَرَّرَ بِهِ أَوْ فَوَّتَ بِهِ حَقًّا أَوْ لَمْ يُفْطِرْ الْعِيدَيْنِ وَالتَّشْرِيقَ وَبَيَانِ تَفْضِيلِ صَوْمِ يَوْمٍ وَإِفْطَارِ يَوْمٍ","eng-name":"Prohibition of Fasting for a lifetime for the one who will be harmed by that or who will neglect other duties, or does not break his fast on the two 'Ids or during the days of At-Tashriq; It is better to fast alternate days","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
