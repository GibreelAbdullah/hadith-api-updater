Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said to him:Observe fast for a day and there would be reward for you for the rest (of the days).

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Observe fast for three days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days. He said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Observe fast for four days and there would be reward for you for the rest of the days. He said: I am capable of doing more than this.
