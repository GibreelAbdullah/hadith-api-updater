'Amr (Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me! 'Abdullah b. 'Amr, it has been conveyed to me that you observe fast during the day and stand in prayer during the whole night. Don't do that, for your body has a share of its own in you, your eye has a share of its own in you, your wife has a share of her own in you. Observe fast and break it too. Fast for three days in every month and that is a prepetual fasting. I said! Messenger of Allah, I have got strength enough (to do more than this), whereupon he said:Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). Observe fast one day and break it (on the other) day. And he ('Abdullah b. 'Amr) used to say: Would that I had availed myself of this concession","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":249},"chapter":{"id":35,"ara-name":"بَاب النَّهْيِ عَنْ صَوْمِ الدَّهْرِ لِمَنْ تَضَرَّرَ بِهِ أَوْ فَوَّتَ بِهِ حَقًّا أَوْ لَمْ يُفْطِرْ الْعِيدَيْنِ وَالتَّشْرِيقَ وَبَيَانِ تَفْضِيلِ صَوْمِ يَوْمٍ وَإِفْطَارِ يَوْمٍ","eng-name":"Prohibition of Fasting for a lifetime for the one who will be harmed by that or who will neglect other duties, or does not break his fast on the two 'Ids or during the days of At-Tashriq; It is better to fast alternate days","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
