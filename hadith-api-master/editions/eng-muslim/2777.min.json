Ka'b (Allah be pleased with him): Your brother (in faith) Ibn Mas'ud says: He who stands (for the night prayer) throughout the year would find Lailat-ul-Qadr, whereupon he said: May Allah have mercy upon him; (he said these words) with the intention that people might not rely only (on one night), whereas he knew that it (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is in the month of Ramadan and it is the twenty-seventh night. He then took oath (without making any exception, i. e. without saying In sha Allah) that it was the twenty-seventh night. I said to him: Abu Mundhir, on what ground do you say that? Thereupon he said: By the indication or by the sign which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave us, and that is that on that day (the sun) would rise without having any ray in it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":13,"hadith":283},"chapter":{"id":40,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ وَالْحَثِّ عَلَى طَلَبِهَا وَبَيَانِ مَحَلِّهَا وَأَرْجَى أَوْقَاتِ طَلَبِهَا","eng-name":"The virtue of Lailat Al-Qadr and the Exhortation to seek it; When it is and the most likely times to seek it","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
