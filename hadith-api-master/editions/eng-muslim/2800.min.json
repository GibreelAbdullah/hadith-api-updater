Ya'la b. Umayya reported that Ya'la used to say to 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him):Would that I see revelation descending upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). (Once) when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in Ji'rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his Companions with him. 'Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the person who entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daubing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) looked at him for a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and 'Umar gestured (with his hand) to Ya'la b. Umayya to come. Ya'la came and he entered his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with his face red, and breathing heavily. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra? The man was searched for and he was brought, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was sewn) and do in 'Umra as you do in Hajj","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":10},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُبَاحُ لِلْمُحْرِمِ بِحَجٍّ أَوْ عُمْرَةٍ وَمَا لاَ يُبَاحُ وَبَيَانِ تَحْرِيمِ الطِّيبِ عَلَيْهِ","eng-name":"What one who has entered Ihram for Hajj or Umrah is permitted to wear, and what is not permissible, and perfume is forbidden for him","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
