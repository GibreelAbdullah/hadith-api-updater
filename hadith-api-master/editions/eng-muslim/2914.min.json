The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who amongst you intends to put on Ihram for `Umra may do so; had I not brought sacrificial animals along with me, I would have put on Ihram for `Umra. She (further said). There were some persons who put on Ihram for `Umra, and some persons who put on Ihram for Hajj, and I was one of those who put on Ihram for `Umra. We went on till we reached Mecca, and on the day of `Arafa I found myself in a state of menses, but I did not put off the Ihram for `Umra. I told about (this state of mine) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whereupon he said: Abandon your `Umra, and undo the hair of your head and comb (them), and put on Ihram for Hajj. She (`A'isha) said: I did accordingly. When it was the night at Hasba and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj, he (the Holy Prophet) sent with me `Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr, and he mounted me behind him on his camel and took me to Tan`im and I put on Ihram for `Umra, and thus Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and `Umra and (we were required to observe) neither sacrifice nor alms nor fasting","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":123},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ وُجُوهِ الإِحْرَامِ وَأَنَّهُ يَجُوزُ إِفْرَادُ الْحَجِّ وَالتَّمَتُّعِ وَالْقِرَانِ وَجَوَازِ إِدْخَالِ الْحَجِّ عَلَى الْعُمْرَةِ وَمَتَى يَحِلُّ الْقَارِنُ مِنْ نُسُكِهِ","eng-name":"Clarifying the types of Ihram; and that it is permissible to perfom Hajj that is Ifrad, Tamattu and Qiran.
