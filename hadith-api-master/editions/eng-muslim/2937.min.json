We said: What does this \"putting off\" imply? He said: Getting out completely from the state of lhram, (so we put off Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes. and we were at a four night's distance from 'Arafa. And we again put on Ihram on the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the people had put off lhram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now (but I can't go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for Hajj.
