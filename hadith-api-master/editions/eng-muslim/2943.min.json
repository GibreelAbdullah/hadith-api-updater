'Abdullah saying: We the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) put on Ihram for Hajj only. Ata' further said that Jabir stated: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) came on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja and he commanded us to put off Ihram. 'Ata'said that he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to put off Ihram and to go to their wives (for intercourse). 'Ata' said: It was not obligatory for them, but (intercourse) with them had become permissible. We said: When only five days had been left to reach 'Arafa, he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to have intercourse with our wives. And we reached 'Arafa in a state as if we had just had intercourse (with them). He ('Ata') said: Jabir pointed with his hand and I (perceive) as if I am seeing his hand as it moved. In the (meantime) the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood amongst us and said: You are well aware that I am the most God-fearing, most truthful and most pious amongst you. And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put off Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later on, I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. So they (the Companions) put off Ihram and we also put it off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: 'Ali came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had entered. (The Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i.e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And 'Ali brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet). Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'shum said: Messenger of Allah, is it (this concession putting off Ihram of Hajj or Umra) meant for this year or is it forever? He said: It is forever","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":152},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ وُجُوهِ الإِحْرَامِ وَأَنَّهُ يَجُوزُ إِفْرَادُ الْحَجِّ وَالتَّمَتُّعِ وَالْقِرَانِ وَجَوَازِ إِدْخَالِ الْحَجِّ عَلَى الْعُمْرَةِ وَمَتَى يَحِلُّ الْقَارِنُ مِنْ نُسُكِهِ","eng-name":"Clarifying the types of Ihram; and that it is permissible to perfom Hajj that is Ifrad, Tamattu and Qiran.
