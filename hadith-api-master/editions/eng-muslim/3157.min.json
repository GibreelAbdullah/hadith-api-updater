Then another (person) came saying: I did not know that the animal was to be sacrificed before shaving, but I got myself shaved before sacrificing the animal, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Sacrifice the animal (now) and there is no harm in it. He (the narrator) said: I did not hear that anything was asked on that day (shout a matter) which a person forgot and could not observe the sequence or anything like it either due to forgetfulness or ignorance, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said (about that): Do it; there is no harm in it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":361},"chapter":{"id":57,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ حَلَقَ قَبْلَ النَّحْرِ أَوْ نَحَرَ قَبْلَ الرَّمْىِ ","eng-name":"It is permissible to offer the sacrifice before stoning the Jamrah, or to shave before offering the sacrifice or stoning the Jamrah, or to perform Tawaf before any of them","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
