Salama al-Hudhali reported:I and Sinan b. Salama proceeded (to Mecca to perform Umra. Sinan had a sacrificial camel with him which he was driving. The camel stopped in the way being completely exhausted and this state of it made him (Sinan) helpless. (He thought) if it stops proceeding further how he would be able to take it, along with him and said: I would definitely find out (the religious verdict) about it. I moved on in the morning and as we encamped at al-Batha', (Sinan) said: Come (along with me) to Ibn 'Abbis (Allah be pleased with them) so that we should narrate to him (this incident), and he (Sinan) reported to him the incident of the sacrificial camel. He (Ibn Abbas) said: You have referred (the matter) to the well informed person. (Now listen) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent sixteen sacrificial camels with a man whom he put in change of them. He set out and came back and said: Messenger of Allah, what should I do with those who are completely exhausted and become powerless to move on, whereupon he said: Slaughter them, and dye their hoofs in their blood, and put them on the sides of their humps, but neither you nor anyone among those who are with you must eat any part of them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":420},"chapter":{"id":66,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُفْعَلُ بِالْهَدْىِ إِذَا عَطِبَ فِي الطَّرِيقِ ","eng-name":"What should be done with the sacrificial animal if it gets injured on the way?","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
