When Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, granted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) victory over Mecca, he stood before people and praised and extolled Allah and then said:Verily Allah held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the domination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after me. So neither molest the game, nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick up a thing dropped but one who makes public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is killed he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take life as (a just retribution). 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah's Messenger, but Idhkhir (a kind of herbage), for we use it for our graves and for our houses, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: With the exception of Idhkhir. A person known as Abu Shah, one of the people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said I Write it for Abu Shah. Walid said: I asked al-Auzai': What did his saying mean:\" Write it for me, Messenger of Allah\"? He said: This very address that he had heard from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":15,"hadith":509},"chapter":{"id":82,"ara-name":"باب تَحْرِيمِ مَكَّةَ وَصَيْدِهَا وَخَلاَهَا وَشَجَرِهَا وَلُقَطَتِهَا إِلاَّ لِمُنْشِدٍ عَلَى الدَّوَام","eng-name":"The sanctity of Makkah and the sanctity of its game, grasses, trees and lost property, except for the one who announces it, is forever","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
