When it occurs to him to do evil, but he does not commit it, I forgive that. But if he commits it, I record one evil against his name. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed. The angels said: That bondsman of Yours intends to commit evil. though His Lord is more Vigilant than he. Upon this He (the Lord) said: Watch him; if he commits (evil), write it against his name but if he refrains from doing it, write one good deed or him, for he desisted from doing it for My sake. The Messenger of Allah said: He who amongst you is good of faith, all his good acts are multiplied from ten to seven hundred times (and are recorded in his name) and all the evils that he commits are recorded as such (i, e. without increase) till he meets Allah","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":243},"chapter":{"id":59,"ara-name":"باب إِذَا هَمَّ الْعَبْدُ بِحَسَنَةٍ كُتِبَتْ وَإِذَا هَمَّ بِسَيِّئَةٍ لَمْ تُكْتَبْ ","eng-name":"If a person thinks of doing a good deed it will be recorded for him, and if he thinks of doing a bad deed it will not be recorded for him","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
