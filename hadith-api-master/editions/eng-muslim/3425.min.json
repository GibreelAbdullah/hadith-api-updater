Ma'bad reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) permitted his Companions to contract temporary marriage with women in the Year of Victory. So I and a friend of mine from Banu Sulaim went out, until we found a young woman of Banu Amir who was like a young she-camel having a long neck. We proposed to her for contracting temporary marriage with us, and presented to her our cloaks (as dower). She began to look and found me more handsome than my friend, but found the cloak of my friend more beautiful than my cloak. She thought in her mind for a while, but then preferred me to my friend. So I remained with her for three (nights), and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded us to part with them (such women)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":16,"hadith":28},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب نِكَاحِ الْمُتْعَةِ وَبَيَانِ أَنَّهُ أُبِيحَ ثُمَّ نُسِخَ ثُمَّ أُبِيحَ ثُمَّ نُسِخَ وَاسْتَقَرَّ تَحْرِيمُهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ","eng-name":"Mut'ah Marriage: It was permitted then abrograted, then permitted then abrogated, and it will remain Forbidden until the day of resurrection","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
