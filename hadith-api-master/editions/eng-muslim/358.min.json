One who had come from Hadramaut said:Messenger of Allah, only this man has appropriated my land which belonged to my father. The one who had came from Kinda contended. This is my land and is in my possession: I cultivate it. There is no right for him in it. The Messenger of Allah said to the Hadramite: Have you any evidence (to support you)? He replied in the negative. He (the Messenger of Allah) said: Then your case is to be decided on his oath. He (the Hadramite) said: Messenger of Allah, he is a liar and cares not what he swears and has no regard for anything. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) remarked: For you then there is no other help to it. He (the man from Kinda) set out to take an oath. When he turned his back the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed: If he took an oath on his property with a view to usurping it, he would certainly meet his Lord in a state that He would turn away from him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":265},"chapter":{"id":61,"ara-name":"باب وَعِيدِ مَنِ اقْتَطَعَ حَقَّ مُسْلِمٍ بِيَمِينٍ فَاجِرَةٍ بِالنَّارِ ","eng-name":"Warning of the Fire for the one who swears a false oath in order to unlawfully take the right of another muslim","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
