So when he divided (his stay) with them, the turn of the first wife did not come but on the ninth (day). They (all the wives) used to gather every night in the house of one where he had to come (and stay that night). It was (the night when he had to stay) in the house of 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her), when Zainab came there. He (the Holy Prophet) stretched his hand towards her (Zainab), whereupon she ('A'isha) said:It is Zainab. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) withdrew his hand. There was an altercation between the two until their voices became loud (and it was at that time) when Iqama was pronounced for prayer. There happened to come Abu Bakr and he heard their voices and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) come for prayer, and throw dust in their mouths. So the Prophet (ﷺ) went out. 'A'isha said: When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) would finish his prayer there would also come Abu Bakr and he would do as he does (on such occasions, i.e. reprimanding). When Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had finished his prayer, there came to her Abu Bakr, and spoke to her ('A'isha) in stern words and said: Do you behave like this?","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":61},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب الْقَسْمِ بَيْنَ الزَّوْجَاتِ وَبَيَانِ أَنَّ السُّنَّةَ أَنْ تَكُونَ لِكُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ لَيْلَةٌ مَعَ يَوْمِهَا","eng-name":"Dividing one's time among co-wives; The Sunnah is for each one to have one night and one day","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
