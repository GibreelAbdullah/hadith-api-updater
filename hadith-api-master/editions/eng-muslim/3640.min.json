'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in an expedition. When we returned I urged my camel to move quickly as it was slow. There met me a rider from behind me and he goaded it with an iron-tipped stick which he had with him. My camel moved forward like the best that you have ever seen. As I turned (my face) I found him to be Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) He said: Jabir, what hastens you? I said: Messenger of Allah, I am newly wedded. whereupon he said: Is it a virgin that you have married or one previously married? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why not a young girl so that you could play with her and she could play with you? Then when we arrived at and were about to enter Medina he said: Wait, so that we may enter by night (i. e. in the evening) in order that the woman with dishevelled hair may comb it, and the woman whose husband had been away may get herself clean; and when you enter (then you have the) enjoyment (of tho wife's company)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":73},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب اسْتِحْبَابِ نِكَاحِ الْبِكْرِ","eng-name":"It is recommended to marry virgins","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
