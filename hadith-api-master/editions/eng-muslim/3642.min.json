'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported:We were with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in a journey, and I was riding a camel meant for carrying water and it lagged behind all persons. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) hit it or goaded it (I think) with something he had with him. And after it (it moved so quickly) that it went ahead of all persons and it struggled with me (to move faster than I permitted It) and I had to restrain it. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. I said: Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He (again) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. ' I said: Allah's Apostle, it is yours. He said to me: Have you married after the death of your father? I said: Yes. He (again) said: With one previously married or a virgin? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why didn't you marry a virgin who might amuse you and you might amuse her, and she might sport with you and you might sport with her? Abu Nadra said: That was the common phrase which the Muslims spoke:\" You do such and such (thing) and Allah may grant you pardon","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":17,"hadith":75},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب اسْتِحْبَابِ نِكَاحِ الْبِكْرِ","eng-name":"It is recommended to marry virgins","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
