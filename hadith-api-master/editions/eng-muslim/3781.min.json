Qasim reported on the authority of his father:'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: There were three issues which were clarified in case of Barira: her owners had decided to sell her on the condition that the right of her inheritance would vest with them. She ('A'isha) said: I made a mention of that to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he said: Buy her and emancipate her, for verily the right of inheritance vests with one who emancipates. She said that she emancipated (her) and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) gave her the option (either to retain her matrimonial alliance or break it after emancipation). She (taking advantage of the option) opted for herself (the severing of matrimonial alliance). 'A'isha said: The people used to give her charity and she gave us that as gift. I made a mention of it to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), whereupon he said: That is charity for her but gift for you, so take that","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":20,"hadith":12},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب إِنَّمَا الْوَلاَءُ لِمَنْ أَعْتَقَ","eng-name":"Al-Wala' (Right of inheritance) belongs to the one who manumits the slave","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
