Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) reported:We used to give on rent land during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).

One day a person from among my uncles came to us and said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade us this act which was a source of benefit to us, but the obedience to Allah and to His Messenger (ﷺ) is more beneficial to us. He forbade us that we should rent land with one-third or one-fourth of (the produce) and the corn of a measure, and he commanded the owner of land that he should cultivate it or let it be cultivated by other (persons) but he showed disapproval of renting it or anything besides it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":144},"chapter":{"id":18,"ara-name":"باب كِرَاءِ الأَرْضِ بِالطَّعَامِ ","eng-name":"Leasing out Land (Kira) in return for food","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
