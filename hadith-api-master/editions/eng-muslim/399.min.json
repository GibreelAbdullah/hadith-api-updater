They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it reaches its place of rest under the Throne and falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is asked: Rise up and return to the place whence you came, and it returns and emerges out from it rising place and the it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything ( unusual in it) till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it would be said to it: Rise up and emerge out from the place of your setting, and it will rise from the place of its setting. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said. Do you know when it would happen? It would happen at the time when faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":304},"chapter":{"id":72,"ara-name":"باب بَيَانِ الزَّمَنِ الَّذِي لاَ يُقْبَلُ فِيهِ الإِيمَانُ ","eng-name":"Clarifying the time when faith will no longer be accepted","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
