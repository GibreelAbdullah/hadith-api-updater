Abdullah reported that he sent his slave with a sa' of wheat and said to him:Sell it, and then buy with it barley. The slave went away and he got a sa' (of barley) and a part of sa' over and above that. When he came to Ma'mar he informed him about that, whereupon Ma'mar said to him: Why did you do that? Go back and return that, and do not accept but weight, for weight, for I used to hear from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: Wheat for wheat and like for like. He (one of the narrators) said: Our food in those days consisted of barley. It was said to him (Ma'mar) that (wheat) is not like that (barley). He replied: I am afraid these may not be similar","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":119},"chapter":{"id":18,"ara-name":"باب بَيْعِ الطَّعَامِ مِثْلاً بِمِثْلٍ ","eng-name":"Selling Food Like for Like","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
