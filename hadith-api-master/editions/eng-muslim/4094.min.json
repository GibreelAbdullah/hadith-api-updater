Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported:I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon himn) as having said this (and Nu'man) pointed towards his ears with his fingers): What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God his declaced unlawful are His preserves. Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":133},"chapter":{"id":20,"ara-name":"باب أَخْذِ الْحَلاَلِ وَتَرْكِ الشُّبُهَاتِ ","eng-name":"Taking that which is lawful and leaving that which is unclear","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
