He died and later on she also died and left a son behind and brothers also, The sons of the woman making life grant said (to those who had been conferred upon this 'Umra):This garden has returned to us. The sons of the one who had been given life grant said: This belonged to our father, during his lifetime and in case of his death. They took their dispute to Tariq, the freed slave of 'Uthman. He called Jabir and he gave testimony of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said: Life grant belongs to one who is conferred upon this (privilege). Tariq gave this decision and then wrote to Abd al-Malik and informed him, Jabir bearing witness to it. Abd al-Malik said: Jabir has told the truth. Then Tariq gave a decree and, as a result thereof, it is to this day that the garden belongs to descendants of one who was conferred upon the life grant","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":24,"hadith":36},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب الْعُمْرَى ","eng-name":"The 'Umra (Lifelong Gift)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
