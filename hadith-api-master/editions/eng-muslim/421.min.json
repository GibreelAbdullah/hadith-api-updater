He (the Holy Prophet) asked: Which valley is this? They said: This is the valley of Azraq Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: (I feel) as if I am seeing Moses (peace be upon him), and then he described something about his complexion and hair, which Diwud (the narrator) could not remember. He (Moses, as described by the Holy Prophet) was keeping his fingers in his ears and was responding loudly to Allah (saying: I am as Thy service, my Lord) while passing through that valley. We then travelled (further) till we came to the mountain trail. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which mountain trail is this? They said: It is the Harsha or Lift. He (the Holy Prophet) said: (I perceive) as if I am seeing Yunus on a red camel, with a cloak of wool around him. The halter of his camel was that of the fibre of date-palm, and he was passing through the valley saying: I am at Thy service! my Lord","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":326},"chapter":{"id":74,"ara-name":"باب الإِسْرَاءِ بِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم إِلَى السَّمَوَاتِ وَفَرْضِ الصَّلَوَاتِ ","eng-name":"The night journey on which the messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken up into the heavens and the prayers were enjoined","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
