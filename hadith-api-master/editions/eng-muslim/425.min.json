Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:I found myself one night near the Ka'bah, and I saw a man with wheat complexion amongst the fair-complexioned men that you ever saw. He had a lock of hair the most beautiful of the locks that you ever saw. He had combed it. Water was trickling out of them. He was leaning on two men, or on the shoulders of two men, and he was circumscribing the Ka'bah. I asked, What is he? It was said: He is al-Masih son of Mary. Then I saw another person, stout and having too much curly hair, and blind in his right eye as if it was a full swollen grape. I asked Who is he? It was said: He is al-Masih al-Dajjal","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":330},"chapter":{"id":75,"ara-name":"باب فِي ذِكْرِ الْمَسِيحِ ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ ","eng-name":"Mentioning Al-Masih Son of Mariam and Al-Masih ad-Dajjal","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
