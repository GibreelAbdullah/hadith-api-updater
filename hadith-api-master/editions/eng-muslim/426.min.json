Umar that one day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mentioned in the presence of people about al-Masih al-Dajjal. He said:Verily Allah (hallowed be He and High) is not blind of one eye. Behold, but the Masih al-Dajjal is blind of right eye as if his eye is like a swollen grape, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: I was shown in a dream in the night that near the Ka'bah there was a man fair-complexioned, fine amongst the white-complexioned men that you ever saw, his locks of hair were falling on his shoulders. He was a man whose hair were neither too curly nor too straight, and water trickled down from his head. He was placing his bands on the shoulders of two persons and amidst them was making a circuit around the Ka'bah. I said: Who is he? They replied: Al-Masih son of Mary. And I saw behind him a man with intensely curly hair, blind of right eye. Amongst the persons I have ever seen Ibn Qatan has the greatest resemblance with him. He was making a circuit around the Ka'bah by placing both his hands on the shoulders of two persons. I said: Who is he? They said; It is al-Masih al-Dajjal","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":331},"chapter":{"id":75,"ara-name":"باب فِي ذِكْرِ الْمَسِيحِ ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ ","eng-name":"Mentioning Al-Masih Son of Mariam and Al-Masih ad-Dajjal","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
