I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before. Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles. I saw Moses saying prayer and found him to be a well-built man as if he was a man of the tribe of Shanu'a. I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) offering prayer, of all of men he had the closest resemblance with 'Urwa b. Masu'd al-Thaqafi. I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering prayer; he had the closest resemblance with your companion (the Prophet himself) amongst people. When the time of prayer came I led them. When I completed the prayer, someone said: Here is Malik, the keeper of the Hell; pay him salutations. I turned to him, but he preceded me in salutation","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":335},"chapter":{"id":75,"ara-name":"باب فِي ذِكْرِ الْمَسِيحِ ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ ","eng-name":"Mentioning Al-Masih Son of Mariam and Al-Masih ad-Dajjal","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
