Suwaid reported:I saw Abu Dharr wearing clothes, and his slave wearing similar ones. I asked him about it, and he narrated that he had abused a person during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upoe. him) and he reproached him for his mother. That person came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and made mention of that to him. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: You are a person who has (remnants of) Ignorance in him. Your slaves are brothers of yours. Allah has placed them in your hand, and he who has his brother under him, he should feed him with what he eats, and dress him with what he dresses himself, and do not burden them beyond their capacities, and if you burden them, (beyond their capacities), then help them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":27,"hadith":62},"chapter":{"id":10,"ara-name":"باب إِطْعَامِ الْمَمْلُوكِ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ وَإِلْبَاسِهِ مَمَّا يَلْبَسُ وَلاَ يُكَلِّفُهُ مَا يَغْلِبُهُ","eng-name":"Feeding a slave what one eats and clothing him as one clothes oneself, and not burdening him with more than he bear","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
