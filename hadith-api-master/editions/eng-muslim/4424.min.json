Samura reported:As he was being brought to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) I saw Ma'iz b. Malik-a short-statured person with strong sinews, having no cloak around him. He bore witness against his own self four times that he had committed adultery, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Perhaps (you kissed her or embraced her). He said: No. by God, one deviating (from the path of virtue) has committed adultery. He then got him stoned (to death), and then delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity of milk. By Allah, in case I get hold of him, I shall certainly punish him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":27},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب مَنِ اعْتَرَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بِالزِّنَا ","eng-name":"One who confesses to Zina","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
