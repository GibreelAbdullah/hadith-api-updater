Malik, came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said:I have committed immorality (adultery), so inflict punishment upon me. Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) turned him away again and again. He then asked his people (about the state of his mind). They said: We do not know of any ailment of his except that he has committed something about which he thinks that he would not be able to relieve himself of its burden but with the Hadd being imposed upon him. He (Ma'iz) came back to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and he commanded us to stone him. We took him to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him. We attacked him with bones, with clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he came upon the ston ground (al-Harra) and stopped there and we stoned him with heavy stones of the Harra until he became motionless (lie died). He (the Holy Prophet) then addressed (us) in the evening saying Whenever we set forth on an expedition in the cause of Allah, some one of those connected with us shrieked (under the pressure of sexual lust) as the bleating of a male goat. It is essential that if a person having committed such a deed is brought to me, I should punish him. He neither begged forgiveness for him nor cursed him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":29,"hadith":31},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب مَنِ اعْتَرَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بِالزِّنَا ","eng-name":"One who confesses to Zina","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
