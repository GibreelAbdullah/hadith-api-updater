Khalid al-Juhani reported:A man came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and asked him about picking up of stray articles. He said: Recognise (well) its bag and the strap (by which it is tied) then make announcement of that for a year. If its owner comes (within this time return that to him), otherwise it is yours. He (again) said: (What about) the lost goat? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: It is yours or for your brother, or for the wolf. He said: (What about) the lost camel? Thereupon he said: You have nothing to do with it; it has a leather bag along with it, and its shoes also. It comes to the watering-place, eats (the leaves of the) trees until its master finds him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب","eng-name":"Picking up property lost by a pilgrim","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
