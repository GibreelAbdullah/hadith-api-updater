Khalid al-Juhani reported that a person asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) about picking up of stray articles, whereupon he said:Make announcement about it for a year, and recognise well the strap and the bag (containing that) ; then spend that; and if its owner comes, make him the payment of that. He (the inquirer) said: Messenger of Allah, what about the lost goat? he said: Take it, for that is yours or for your brother, or for the wolf. He (again) said: (What about) the lost camel? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was enraged until his cheeks became red (or his face became red) and then said: You have nothing to do about that; it has feet and a leather bag (to quench its thirst) until its owner finds it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":31,"hadith":2},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب","eng-name":"Picking up property lost by a pilgrim","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
