'Azib):Abu Umara, did you flee on the Day of Hunain? He replied: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not retreat. (What actually happened was that some hasty young men who were either inadequately armed or were unarmed met a group of men from Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir who happened to be (excellent) archers. The latter shot at them a volley of arrows that did not miss. The people turned to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Abu Sufyan b. Harith was leading his mule. So he got down, prayed and invoked God's help. He said: I am the Prophet. This is no untruth. I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib. O God, descend Thy help. Bara' continued: When the battle grew fierce. we, by God. would seek protection by his side, and the bravest among us was he who confronted the onslaught and it was the Prophet (ﷺ)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":98},"chapter":{"id":28,"ara-name":"باب فِي غَزْوَةِ حُنَيْنٍ ","eng-name":"The Battle of Hunain","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
