He said to 'Ali: Write down the terms settled between us. (So 'Ali wrote): In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful. This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled (with the Meccans), The polytheists said to him: If we knew that thou art the Messenger of of Allah, we would follow you. But write: Muhammad b. 'Abdullah. So he told 'Ali to strike out these words. 'Ali said: No, by Allah, I will not strike them out. The Messenger of Allah (may Peace be upon him) said: Show me their place (on the parchment). So he ('Ali) showed him their place and he (the Holy Prophet) struck them out; and 'Ali wrote: Ibn 'Abdullah. (According to the terms of the treaty, next year) the Prophet (ﷺ) stayed there for three days When it was the third day, they said to 'Ali: This is the last day according to the terms of your companion. So tell him to leave. 'Ali informed the Prophet (ﷺ) accordingly. He said: Yes, and left (the city). Ibn Janab in his version of the tradition used:\" we would swear allegiance to you\" instead of\" we would follow you","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":32,"hadith":113},"chapter":{"id":34,"ara-name":"باب صُلْحِ الْحُدَيْبِيَةِ فِي الْحُدَيْبِيَةِ ","eng-name":"The truce of Al-Hudaybiyah","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
