He said. We would come on the Day of Resurrection like this, like this, and see. carefully. that which concerns\" elevated people\". He (the narrator) said:Then the people would be summoned along with their idols whom they worshipped, one after another. Then our Lord would come to us and say: Whom are you waiting for? They would say: We are waiting for our Lord. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: (We are not sure) till we gaze at Thee, and He would manifest Himself to them smilingly, and would go along with them and they would follow Him; and every person, whether a hypocrite or a believer, would be endowed with a light, and there would be spikes and hooks on the bridge of the Hell, which would catch hold of those whom Allah willed. Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the believers would secure salvation. and the first group to achieve it would comprise seventy thousand men who would have the brightness of full moon on their faces, and they would not be called to account. Then the people immediately following them would have their faces as the brightest stars in the heaven. This is how (the groups would follow one after another). Then the stage of intercession would come, and they (who are permitted to intercede) would intercede, till he who had declared:\" There is no god but Allah\" and had in his heart virtue of the weight of a barley grain would come out of the Fire. They would be then brought in the courtyard of Paradise and the inhabitants of Paradise would begin to sprinkle water over them till they would sprout like the sprouting of a thing in flood water, and their burns would disappear. They would ask their Lord till they would be granted (the bounties) of the world and with it ten more besides it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":375},"chapter":{"id":84,"ara-name":"باب أَدْنَى أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَةً فِيهَا ","eng-name":"The Status of the Lowest people in paradise","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
