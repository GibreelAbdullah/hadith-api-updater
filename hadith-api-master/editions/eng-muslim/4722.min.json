Shumasa who said:I came to A'isha to inquire something from her. She said: From which people art thou? I said: I am from the people of Egypt. She said: What was the behaviour of your governor towards you in this war of yours? I said: We did not experience anything bad from him. If the camel of a man from us died, he would bestow on him a camel. If any one of us lost his slave, he would give him a slave. If anybody was in need of the basic necessities of life, he would provide them with provisions. She said: Behold! the treatment that was meted out to my brother, Muhammad b. Abu Bakr, does not prevent me from telling you what I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said in this house of mine: O God, who (happens to) acquire some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is hard upon them-be Thou hard upon him, and who (happens to) acquire some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is kind to them-be Thou kind to him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":22},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب فَضِيلَةِ الإِمَامِ الْعَادِلِ وَعُقُوبَةِ الْجَائِرِ وَالْحَثِّ عَلَى الرِّفْقِ بِالرَّعِيَّةِ وَالنَّهْيِ عَنْ إِدْخَالِ الْمَشَقَّةِ عَلَيْهِمْ","eng-name":"The virtue of a just ruler and the punishment of a tyrant; Encouragement to treat those under one's authority with kindness and the prohibition against causing them hardship","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
