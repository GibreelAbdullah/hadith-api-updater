Bashir who said:As I was (sitting) near the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a man said: I do not care if, after embracing Islam, I do not do any good deed (except) distributing drinking water among the pilgrims. Another said: I do not care if, after embracing Islam, I do not do any good deed beyond maintenance service to the Sacred Mosque. Another said: Jihad in the way of Allah is better than what you have said. 'Umar reprimanded them and said: Don't raise your voices near the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on Friday. When prayer was over, I entered (the apartment of the Holy Prophet) and asked his verdict about the matter in which they had differed. (It was upon this that) Allah, the Almighty and Exalted, revealed the Qur'anic verse:\" Do you make the giving of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the service of those) who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive hard in the cause of Allah. They are not equal in the sight of God. And Allah guides not the wrongdoing people\" (ix)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":167},"chapter":{"id":29,"ara-name":"باب فَضْلِ الشَّهَادَةِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى ","eng-name":"The virtue of Martyrdom in the cause of Allah","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
