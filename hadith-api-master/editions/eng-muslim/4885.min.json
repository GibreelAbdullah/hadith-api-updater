Nay, they are alive, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord..\" (iii. 169). He said: We asked the meaning of the verse (from the Holy Prophet) who said: The souls, of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds who have their nests in chandeliers hung from the throne of the Almighty. They eat the fruits of Paradise from wherever they like and then nestle in these chandeliers. Once their Lord cast a glance at them and said: Do ye want anything? They said: What more shall we desire? We eat the fruit of Paradise from wherever we like. Their Lord asked them the same question thrice. When they saw that they will continue to be asked and not left (without answering the question). they said: O Lord, we wish that Thou mayest return our souls to our bodies so that we may be slain in Thy way once again. When He (Allah) saw that they had no need, they were left (to their joy in heaven)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":33,"hadith":181},"chapter":{"id":33,"ara-name":"باب فِي بَيَانِ أَنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَأَنَّهُمْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ","eng-name":"The souls of the martyrs are in Paradise, and they are alive with their Lord and they have provision","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
