Hatim reported:I said: Messenger of Allah, I set off trained dogs and they catch for me (the game) and I recite the name of Allah over it (I slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you set off your trained dogs, if you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then eat (the game). I said: Even if they (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I throw Mi'rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game). Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi'rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":34,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب الصَّيْدِ بِالْكِلاَبِ الْمُعَلَّمَةِ ","eng-name":"Hunting with trained dogs and arrows","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
