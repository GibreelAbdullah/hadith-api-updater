Khadij is reported to have said:Allah's Messenger, we are going to encounter the enemy tomorrow, but we have no knives with us. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Make haste or be careful (in making arrangements for procuring knives) which would let the blood flow (and along with it) the name of Allah is also to be recited. Then eat, but not the tooth or nail. And I am going to tell you why it is not permissible to slaughter the animal with the help of tooth and bone; and as for the nail. it is a bone, and the bone is the knife of Abyssinians. He (the narrator) said: There fell to our lot as spoils of war camels and goats, and one of the camels among them became wild. A person (amongst usl struck It with an arrow which brought it under control. whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: This camel became wild like wild animals, so if you find any animal getting wild, you do the same with that","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":35,"hadith":29},"chapter":{"id":4,"ara-name":"باب جَوَازِ الذَّبْحِ بِكُلِّ مَا أَنْهَرَ الدَّمَ إِلاَّ السِّنَّ وَالظُّفُرَ وَسَائِرَ الْعِظَامِ ","eng-name":"The permissibility of slaughtering with anything that makes the blood flow, except teeth and other bones","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
