Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass) in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa'. I saught to give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said:Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn Shihab reported 'Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and there was Zaid b, Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"باب تَحْرِيمِ الْخَمْرِ وَبَيَانِ أَنَّهَا تَكُونُ مِنْ عَصِيرِ الْعِنَبِ وَمِنَ التَّمْرِ وَالْبُسْرِ وَالزَّبِيبِ وَغَيْرِهَا مِمَّا يُسْكِرُ","eng-name":"The prohibition of Khamr, which may be made from the juice of grapes, dried dates, unripe dates, raisins and other things that intoxicate","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
