Malik reported:I visited Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) one day and found him sitting in the company of his Companions and talking to them, and he had tied his belly with a bandage. Usama said: I am in doubt whether there was stone on that (his belly) or not. I asked some of his Companions why Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had bandaged his belly. They said: (He has done that to relieve) his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the daughter of Milhan, and said to him: Father, I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said that it was due to hunger. Abu Talha came to mv mother and said: Is there anything? She said: Yes, I have some pieces of bread with me and some dates. If Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) comes to us alone we can feed him to his fill, but if someone comes along with him this would be insufficient for them. The rest of the hadith is the same","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":197},"chapter":{"id":20,"ara-name":"باب جَوَازِ اسْتِتْبَاعِهِ غَيْرَهُ إِلَى دَارِ مَنْ يَثِقُ بِرِضَاهُ بِذَلِكَ وَيَتَحَقَّقُهُ تَحَقُّقًا تَامًّا وَاسْتِحْبَابِ الاِجْتِمَاعِ عَلَى الطَّعَامِ","eng-name":"It is permissible to take someone else to the house of one who you are certain will approve of that and will not mind.
