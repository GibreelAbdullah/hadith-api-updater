Maimuna said:Allah's Messenger, I find a change in your mood today. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Gabriel had promised me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his promises, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spent the day in this sad (mood). Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture. Then on that very morning he commanded the killing of the dogs until he announced that the dog kept for the orchards should also be killed, but he spared the dog meant for the protection of extensive fields (or big gardens)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":128},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"بَاب تَحْرِيمِ تَصْوِيرِ صُورَةِ الْحَيَوَانِ وَتَحْرِيمِ اتِّخَاذِ مَا فِيهِ صُورَةٌ غَيْرُ مُمْتَهَنَةٍ بِالْفَرْشِ وَنَحْوِهِ","eng-name":"The Prohibition Of Making Images Of Living Beings, And The Prohibition Of Using Images That Are Not Subjected To Disrespect In Furnishings And The Like; The Angels (Peace Be Upon Them) Do Not Enter A House In Which There Is An Image Or A Dog","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
