I came to 'A'isha and said to her: This is a news that I have received that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or a dog, (and further added) whether she had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) making a mention of it. She said: No (I did not hear this myself), but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet) did not find fault with it","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":134},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"بَاب تَحْرِيمِ تَصْوِيرِ صُورَةِ الْحَيَوَانِ وَتَحْرِيمِ اتِّخَاذِ مَا فِيهِ صُورَةٌ غَيْرُ مُمْتَهَنَةٍ بِالْفَرْشِ وَنَحْوِهِ","eng-name":"The Prohibition Of Making Images Of Living Beings, And The Prohibition Of Using Images That Are Not Subjected To Disrespect In Furnishings And The Like; The Angels (Peace Be Upon Them) Do Not Enter A House In Which There Is An Image Or A Dog","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
