When it was morning. Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and informed him, whereupon he said: Did you spend the night with her. He said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: O Allah, bless both of them (and as a result of blessing) she gave birth to a child. Abu Talha said to me (Anas b. Malik) to take the child, (so I took him) and came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). She (Umm Sulaim) also had sent some dates (along with the child).
