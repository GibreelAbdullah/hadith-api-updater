We said to him: What is the matter? He said: 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) sent for me. I went to him and paid him salutation thrice at (his) door but he made no response to me and so I came back. Thereupon he ('Umar) said: What stood in your way that you did not turn up? I said: I did come to you and paid you salutations at your door three times but I was not given any response, so I came back as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has said: When any one of you seeks permission three times and he is not granted permission, he should come back. Umar said: Bring a witness to support that you say, otherwise I shall take you to task. Ubayy b. Ka'b said: None should stand with him (as a witness) but the youngest amongst the people. Abu Sa'id said: I am the youngest amongst the people, whereupon he said: Then you go with him (to support his contention)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":38,"hadith":41},"chapter":{"id":7,"ara-name":"باب الاِسْتِئْذَانِ ","eng-name":"Seeking Permission To Enter A House","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
