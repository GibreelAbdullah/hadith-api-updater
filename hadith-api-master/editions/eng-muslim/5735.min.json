Is there any incantator amongst you? A person amongst us stood up (and went with her). We had no idea that he had been a good incantator but he practiced incantation with the help of Sura al-Fatiha and the (the chief) was all right. They gave him a flock of sheep and served us milk. We said (to him): Are you a good incantator. Thereupon he said: I did not do it but by the help of Sura al-Fatiha. He said: Do not drive (these goats) until we go to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and find out (whether it is permissible to accept (this reward of incantation). So we came to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: How did you come to know that this (Sura al-Fatiha) could be used as an incantation?
