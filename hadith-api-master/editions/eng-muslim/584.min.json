The abode of the believing people and we, if God so wills, are about to join you. I love to see my brothers.\" They (the hearers) said: Aren't we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: You are my companions, and our brothers are those who have, so far, not come into the world. They said: Messenger of Allah, how would you recognise those persons of your Ummah who have not yet been born? He said: Supposing a man had horses with white blazes on foreheads and legs among horses which were all black, tell me, would he not recognise his own horses? They said: Certainly, O Messenger of Allah. He said: They would come with white faces and arms and legs owing to ablution, and I would arrive at the Cistern before them. Some people would be driven away from my Cistern as the stray camel is driven away. I would call out: Come, come. Then it would be said (to me): These people changed themselves after you, and I would say: Be off, be off","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":2,"hadith":51},"chapter":{"id":12,"ara-name":"باب اسْتِحْبَابِ إِطَالَةِ الْغُرَّةِ وَالتَّحْجِيلِ فِي الْوُضُوءِ ","eng-name":"The recommendation to increase the area washed for the forehead, arms, and legs well when performing wudu’","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
