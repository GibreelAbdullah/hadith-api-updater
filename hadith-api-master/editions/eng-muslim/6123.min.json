Malik reported that the people asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) until he was hard pressed. He went out one day and he occupied the pulpit and said:Ask me and I shall leave no question of yours unanswered for you, and when the people heard about it they were overawed, as if (something tragic) was going to happen. Anas said: I began to look towards the right and the left and (found) that every person was weeping wrapping his head with the cloth. Then a person in the mosque broke the ice and they used to dispute with him by attributing his fatherhood to another man than his own father. He said: Allah's Apostle, who is my father? He said: Your father is Hudhafa. Then 'Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) dared say something and said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as our Messenger, seeking refuge with Allah from the evil of Turmoil. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Never did I see the good and evil as today. Paradise and Hell were given a visible shape before me (in this worldly life) and I saw both of them near this well","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":181},"chapter":{"id":37,"ara-name":"باب تَوْقِيرِهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَتَرْكِ إِكْثَارِ سُؤَالِهِ عَمَّا لاَ ضَرُورَةَ إِلَيْهِ أَوْ لاَ يَت","eng-name":"Respecting Him And Not Asking Him Unnecessary Questions","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
