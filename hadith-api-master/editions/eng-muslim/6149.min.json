Moses (peace be upon him) gave a blow at the eye of the Angel of Death and knocked it out. The Angel went back to Allah (the Exalted) and said: You sent me to your servant who does not like to die and he knocked out my eye. Allah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight) and said: Go to My servant and say: Do you want life? And in case you want life, keep your hand on the body of the ox and you would live such number of years as the (number of) hair your hand covers. He (Moses) said: What, then? He said: Then you would die, whereupon he (Moses) said: Then why not now? (He then prayed): Allah, cause me to die close to the sacred land. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Had I been near that place I would have shown his grave by the side of the path at the red mound","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":43,"hadith":207},"chapter":{"id":42,"ara-name":"باب مِنْ فَضَائِلِ مُوسَى صلى الله عليه وسلم ","eng-name":"The Virtues Of Musa, Peace Be Upon Him","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
