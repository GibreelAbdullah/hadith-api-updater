I again made an attempt to lift the cloth, but my people prohibited me. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) lifted it or he commanded it to be lifted. He heard the noise (of a loud) weeping, or the noise of a woman mourner. He inquired who she was. They said: The daughter of 'Amr or the sister of Amr, whereupon he said: Why does she weep?
