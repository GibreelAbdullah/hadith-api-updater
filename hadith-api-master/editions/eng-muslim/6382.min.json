'Ubaida reported:I was (sitting) in a company in which there were (besides others) Sa'd b. Malik and Ibn 'Umar that 'Abdullah b. Saliim happened to pass (by that side). They (the people sitting in that company) said: He is a person from amongst the dwellers of Paradise. I stood up and said to him: They say such and such (thing about you), whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, it is not meet for them to say (anything) of which They have no knowledge. Verily I saw as if a pillar had been raised in a green garden and there had been fixed at its (upper) end a handhold and there was a helper at its base. It was said to me: Climb up. So I climbed up and caught hold of the haildhold. I narrated (the contents of this dream) to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whereupon he said: 'Abdullah would die in a state that he would be catching hold of the firmest handhold (he would die holding fast to the faith)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":44,"hadith":212},"chapter":{"id":33,"ara-name":"باب مِنْ فَضَائِلِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ سَلاَمٍ رضى الله عنه ","eng-name":"The Virtues Of Abdullah Bin Salam (RA)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
