Amr reported that Abu Sufyan came to Salman, Suhaib and Bilal in the presence of a group of persons.

Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Do you say this to the old man of the Quraish and their chief? Then he came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon'him) and informed him of this. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Abu Bakr, you have perhaps annoyed them and if you annoyed them you have in fact annoyed your Lord.
