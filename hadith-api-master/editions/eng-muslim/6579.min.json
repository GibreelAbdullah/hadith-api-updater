He (the Holy Prophet) said: The poor of my Umma would be he who would come on the Day of Resurrection with prayers and fasts and Zakat but (he would find himself bankrupt on that day as he would have exhausted his funds of virtues) since he hurled abuses upon others, brought calumny against others and unlawfully consumed the wealth of others and shed the blood of others and beat others, and his virtues would be credited to the account of one (who suffered at his hand). And if his good deeds fall short to clear the account, then his sins would be entered in (his account) and he would be thrown in the Hell-Fire","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":77},"chapter":{"id":15,"ara-name":"باب تَحْرِيمِ الظُّلْمِ ","eng-name":"The Prohibition Of Oppression","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
