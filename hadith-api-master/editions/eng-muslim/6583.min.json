Abdullah reported:We were along with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in an expedition that a person from amongst the emigrants struck at the back of a person from the Ansir. The Ansiri said: O Ansar! And the Muhijir said: O Emigrants! Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What are these proclamations of the Days of Ignorance? They said: Allah's Messenger, a person from the emigrants struck at the back of an Ansari, whereupon he said: It is something disgusting. 'Abdullah b. Ubayy heard it and said: They have indeed done it. By Allah, when we would return to Medina the respectable amongst them (the Ansar) would turn away the mean (the emigrants). Thereupon 'Umar said: Permit me so that I should strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: Leave him, the people may not say that Muhammad kills his companions","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":81},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب نَصْرِ الأَخِ ظَالِمًا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا ","eng-name":"Supporting One's Brother Whether He Is Doing Wrong Or Being Wronged","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
