Malik reported that there was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaim (who was the mother of Anas). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw that orphan girl and said:O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! That slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) has invoked curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age, or she said, in my (length) of life. Umm Sulaim went out wrapping her head-dress hurriedly until she met Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He said to her: Umm Sulaim, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle, you invoked curse upon my orphan girl. He said: Umm Sulaim, what is that? She said: She (the orphan girl) states you have cursed her saying that she might not grow in age or grow in life. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and then said: Umm Sulaim, don't you know that I have made this term with my Lord. And the term with my Lord is that I said to Him: 1 am a human being and I am pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human being loses temper, so for any person from amongst my Ummah whom I curse and he in no way deserves it, let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification and purity and nearness to (Allah) on the Day of Resurrection","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":124},"chapter":{"id":25,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ لَعَنَهُ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَوْ سَبَّهُ أَوْ دَعَا عَلَيْهِ","eng-name":"Whomever Is Cursed, Reviled Or Prayed Against By The Prophet (ﷺ) When He Does Not Deserve That, It Will Be Purification, Reward And Mercy For Him","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
