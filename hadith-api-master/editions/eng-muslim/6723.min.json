Mas'ud) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who is the most truthful (of the human beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) said:Verily your creation is on this wise. The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother's womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":46,"hadith":1},"chapter":{"id":1,"ara-name":"بَاب كَيْفِيَّةِ خَلْقِ الْآدَمِيِّ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ وَكِتَابَةِ رِزْقِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَشَقَاوَتِهِ وَسَعَادَتِهِ","eng-name":"How The Human Being Is Created, In His Mother's Womb, And His Provision, Lifespan And Deeds Are Written Down, And His Misery and Happiness","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
