Abdullah reported that some desert Arabs clad in woollen clothes came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He saw them in sad plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:He who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their's being diminished in any respect","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":26},"chapter":{"id":6,"ara-name":"باب مَنْ سَنَّ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً أَوْ سَيِّئَةً وَمَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى أَوْ ضَلاَلَةٍ","eng-name":"The One Who Starts Something Good Or Something Bad; The One Who Calls Others To Guidance Or Misguidance","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
