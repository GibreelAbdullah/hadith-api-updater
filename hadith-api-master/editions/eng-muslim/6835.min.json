Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:Did you supplicate for anything or beg of Him about that? He said: Yes. I used to utter (these words): Impose punishment upon me earlier in this world, what Thou art going to impose upon me in the Hereafter. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Hallowed be Allah, you have neither the power nor forbearance to take upon yourself (the burden of His Punishment). Why did you not say this: O Allah, grant us good in the world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of Fire. He (the Holy Prophet) made this supplication (for him) and he was all right","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":31},"chapter":{"id":7,"ara-name":"باب كَرَاهَةِ الدُّعَاءِ بِتَعْجِيلِ الْعُقُوبَةِ فِي الدُّنْيَا","eng-name":"It Is Disliked To Pray For Punishment To Be Brought Forward In This World","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
