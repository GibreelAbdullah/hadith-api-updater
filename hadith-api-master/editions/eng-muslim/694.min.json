The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Do everything except intercourse. The Jews heard of that and said: This man does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it. Usaid b. Hudair and Abbad b. Bishr came and said: Messenger of Allah, the Jews say such and such thing. We should not have, therefore, any contactwith them (as the Jews do). The face of the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them, but when they went out, they happened to receive a gift of milk which was sent to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He (the Holy Prophet) called for them and gave them drink, whereby they knew that he was not angry with them","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":16},"chapter":{"id":3,"ara-name":"باب جَوَازِ غَسلِ الْحَائِضِ رَأْسَ زَوْجِهَا وَتَرْجِيلِهِ وَطَهَارَةِ سُؤْرِهَا وَالاِتِّكَاءِ فِي حِجْرِهَا وَقِرَاءَةِ الْقُرْآنِ فِيهِ","eng-name":"It is permissible for a menstruating woman to wash her husband’s head, and comb his hair; her leftovers are pure (tahir); and regarding reclining in her lap and reciting Qur’an","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
