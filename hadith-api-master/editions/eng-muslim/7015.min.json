Muhriz reported that a person said to Ibn 'Umar:How did you hear Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying something about intimate conversation? He said: I heard him say: A believer will be brought to his Lord, the Exalted and Glorious, on the Day of Resurrection and He would place upon him His veil (of Light) and make him confess his faults and say: Do you recognise (your faults)? He would say: My Lord, I do recognise (them). He (the Lord) would say: I concealed them for you in the world. And today I forgive them. And he would then be given the Book containing (the account of his) good deeds. And so far as the non-believers and hypocrites are concerned, there would be general announcement about them before all creation telling them that these (people, i. e. non-believers and hypocrites) told a lie about Allah","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":50,"hadith":61},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب قَبُولِ تَوْبَةِ الْقَاتِلِ وَإِنْ كَثُرَ قَتْلُهُ ","eng-name":"The Acceptance Of The Repentance Of The One Who Kills, Even If He Has Killed A Great Deal","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
