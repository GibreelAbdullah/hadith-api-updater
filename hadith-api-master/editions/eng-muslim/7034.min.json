'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported that Marwan said to Rafi', his chamberlain, that he should go to Ibn 'Abbas and ask him:If every one of us be punished for his being happy upon his deed and for his being praised for what he has not done, nobody would be saved from the torment. Ibn 'Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book.\" Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:\" When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this\" (iii. 186), and then Ibn 'Abbas recited this verse:\" Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done\" (iii. 186). Ibn 'Abbas (further) said: Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":11},"chapter":{"id":0,"ara-name":"باب ","eng-name":"","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
