Mas'ud reported that a Jewish scholar came to Allah's Apostle (may peace he upon him) and said:Muhammad, or Abu al-Qasim, verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious would carry the Heavens on the Day of Judgment upon one finger and earths upon one finger and the mountains and trees upon one finger and the ocean and moist earth upon one finger, and in fact the whole of the creation upon one finger, and then He would stir them and say: I am your Lord, I am your Lord. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled testifying what that scholar had said. He then recited this verse:\" And they honour not Allah with the honour due to Him; and the whole earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heaven rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him I and highly Exalted is He above what they associate (with Him)\" (Az-Zumar:)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":52,"hadith":2},"chapter":{"id":0,"ara-name":"باب ","eng-name":"","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
