Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:There is a tree amongst trees, the leaves of which do not wither and that is like a Muslim; tell me which that (tree) can be? The people began to think of the trees of the forest. Abdullah said: I thought that it could be the date-palm tree, but I felt hesitant (to say that). They (the Companions) then said: Allah's Messenger, (kindly) tell us which that can be? Thereupon he said: It is the date-palm tree. I made a mention of that to 'Umar, whereupon he said: Had you said that it meant the date-palin tree, this statement of yours (would have been dearer to me) than such and such things","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":52,"hadith":52},"chapter":{"id":15,"ara-name":"باب مَثَلُ الْمُؤْمِنِ مَثَلُ النَّخْلَةِ ","eng-name":"The Likeness Of The Believer Is That Of A Date Palm","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
