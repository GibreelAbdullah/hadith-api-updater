Then he came and he saw me (in what agitated state of mind) I was. He said:A'isha, what has happened to you? Do you feel jealous? Thereupon she said: How can it be (that a woman like me) should not feel jealous in regard to a husband like you. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It was your devil who had come to you, and she said: Allah's Messenger, is there along with me a devil? He said: Yes. I said: Is a devil attached to everyone? He said: Yes. I (Aisha) again said: Allah's Messenger, is it with you also? He said: Yes, but my Lord has helped me against him and as such I am absolutely safe from his mischief","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":52,"hadith":64},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"بَاب تَحْرِيشِ الشَّيْطَانِ وَبَعْثِهِ سَرَايَاهُ لِفِتْنَةِ النَّاسِ وَأَنَّ مَعَ كُلِّ إِنْسَانٍ قَرِينًا","eng-name":"The Mischief Of The Shaitan And How He Sends His Troops To Tempt People, And With Every Person There Is A Qarin (Companion From Among The Jinn)","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
