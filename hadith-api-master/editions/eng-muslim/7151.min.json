Munabbih reported:These are some of the ahidith which Abu Huraira reported from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one is this that he is reported to have said: The (members of the) first group that would be admitted to Paradise would have their faces as bright as full moon during the night. They would neither spit nor suffer catarrh, nor void excrement. They would have their utensils and their combs made of gold and silver and the fuel of their braziers would be aloes and their sweat would be musk and every one of them would have two spouses (so beautiful) that the marrow of their shanks would be visible through the flesh. There would be no dissension amongst them and no enmity in their hearts. Their hearts would be like one heart, glorifying Allah morning and evening","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":53,"hadith":20},"chapter":{"id":7,"ara-name":"باب فِي صِفَاتِ الْجَنَّةِ وَأَهْلِهَا وَتَسْبِيحِهِمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا ","eng-name":"The Attributes Of Paradise And Its People, And Their Glorifying Allah Every Morning And Evening","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
