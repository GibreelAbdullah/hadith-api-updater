And I have seen its eastern and western ends. And the dominion of my Ummah would reach those ends which have been drawn near me and I have been granted the red and the white treasure and I begged my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be destroyed because of famine, nor be dominated by an enemy who is not amongst them to take their lives and destroy them root and branch, and my Lord said: Muhammad, whenever I make a decision, there is none to change it. I grant you for your Ummah that it would not be destroyed by famine and it would not be dominated by an enemy who would not be amongst it and would take their lives and destroy them root and branch even if all the people from the different parts of the world join hands together (for this purpose), but it would be from amongst them, viz. your Ummah, that some people would kill the others or imprison the others","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":24},"chapter":{"id":5,"ara-name":"باب هَلاَكُ هَذِهِ الأُمَّةِ بَعْضِهِمْ بِبَعْضٍ","eng-name":"(Parts of) This Ummah Will Destroy One Another","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
