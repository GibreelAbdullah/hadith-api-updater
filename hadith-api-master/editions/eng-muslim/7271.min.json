I said: They would shed their blood today. That person said: By Allah. not at all. I said: By Allah, of course, they would do it. He said: By Allah, they would not do it. I said: By Allah, of course, they would do it. He said: By Allah, they would not do it, and I have heard a hadith of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which I am narrating to you in this connection. I said: You are a bad seat fellow. I have been opposing you since morning and you are listening to me in spite of the fact that you have heard a hadith from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) (contrary to my statement). I myself felt that there was no use of this annoyance. (He could tell me earlier that it was a hadith of the Prophet (may peace be upon him], and I would not have opposed him at all.)
