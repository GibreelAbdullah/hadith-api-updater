Rufai' reported on the authority of Abu Tufail who reported on the authority of Abu Sariha a hadith like this that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) did not make a mention of (the tenth sign) but he said that out of the ten one was the descent of Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him), and in another version it is the blowing of the violent gale which would drive the people to the ocean","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":52},"chapter":{"id":13,"ara-name":"باب فِي الآيَاتِ الَّتِي تَكُونُ قَبْلَ السَّاعَةِ","eng-name":"The Signs Which Will Appear Before The Hour","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
