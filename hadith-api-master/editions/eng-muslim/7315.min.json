'Abdullah that he said it may happen that the people of Iraq may not send their qafiz and dirhams (their measures of food stuff and their money). We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said: The non-Arabs would prevent them. He again said: There is the possibility that the people of Syria may not send their dinars and mudds. We said: Who would be responsible for it? He said this prevention would be made by the Romans. He (Jabir b. Abdullah) kept quiet for a while and then reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said there would be a caliph in the last (period) of my Ummah who would freely give handfuls of wealth to the people without counting it. I said to Abu Nadra and Abu al-'Ala: Do you mean 'Umar b. 'Abd al-Aziz? They said: No (he would be Imam Mahdi)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":81},"chapter":{"id":18,"ara-name":"بَاب لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى يَمُرَّ الرَّجُلُ بِقَبْرِ الرَّجُلِ فَيَتَمَنَّى أَنْ يَكُونَ مَكَانَ الْمَيِّتِ مِنْ الْبَلَاءِ","eng-name":"The Hour Will Not Begin Until A Man Passes By Another Man's Grave And Wishes That He Was In The Place Of The Deceased, Because Of Calamity","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
