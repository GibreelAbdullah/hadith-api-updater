'Asim b. Urwa b. Mas'ud reported:I heard a person saying to 'Abdullah b. Amr: You say that the Last Hour would come at such and such time, whereupon he said: I had made up my mind that I would not narrate anything to you. I only said: But you would soon see after some time a very significant affair, for example the burning of the House (Ka'ba). Shu'ba said like this and 'Abdullah b Amr reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) having said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah. And in another hadith (the words are): None would survive who would have even a speck of faith in his heart, but he would be dead. Muhammad b. Ja'far reported that Shu'ba narrated to him this hadith many a time and I also read it out to him many a time","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":54,"hadith":143},"chapter":{"id":23,"ara-name":"بَاب فِي خُرُوجِ الدَّجَّالِ وَمُكْثِهِ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَنُزُولِ عِيسَى وَقَتْلِهِ إِيَّاهُ","eng-name":"The Emergence Of Ad-Dajjal And His Stay On Earth, And The Descent Of 'Eisa Who Will Kill Him.
