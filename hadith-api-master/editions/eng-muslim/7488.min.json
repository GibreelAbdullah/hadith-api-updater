I came back to my mother and informed her about it, and when he came to her she said: My son sneezed in your presence and you did not say:\" Allah may have mercy upon you, and she sneezed and you said for her:\" May Allah have mercy upon you.\" Thereupon he said: Your son sneezed but he did not praise Allah and I did not beg mercy of Allah for him and she sneezed and she praised Allah and so I said: May Allah have mercy upon you, as I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: When any one of you sneezes he should praise Allah and the other should say: May Allah have mercy upon you, and if he does not praise Allah, no mercy should be begged for him","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":55,"hadith":71},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب تَشْمِيتِ الْعَاطِسِ وَكَرَاهَةِ التَّثَاؤُبِ","eng-name":"Saying: \"May Allah Have Mercy On You\" To One Who Sneezes, And Yawning Is Disliked","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
