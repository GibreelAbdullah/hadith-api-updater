What we heard (i. e. recitation) from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), we made you listen to that. And that which he (recited) inwardly, we (recited) inwardly for you. A person said to him:If I add nothing to the (recitation) of the Umm al Qur'an (Surat al-Fatiha), would it make the prayer incomplete? He (AbuHuraira) said: If you add to that (if you recite some of verses of the Qur'an along with Surat at-Fatiha) that is better for you. But if you are contented with it (Surat al-Fatiha) only, it is sufficient for you","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":45},"chapter":{"id":11,"ara-name":"باب وُجُوبِ قِرَاءَةِ الْفَاتِحَةِ فِي كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ وَإِنَّهُ إِذَا لَمْ يُحْسِنِ الْفَاتِحَةَ وَلاَ أَمْكَنَهُ تَعَلُّمُهَا قَرَأَ مَا تَيَسَّرَ لَهُ مِنْ غَيْرِهَا","eng-name":"It Is Obligatory To Recite Al-Fatihah In Every Rak'ah; If A Person Cannot Recite Al-Fatihah Or Cannot Learn It, Then He Should Recite Whatever Else He Can Manage","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
