The Mes- senger of Allah (ﷺ) returned his salutation and said: Go back and pray, for you have not offered the prayer. He again prayed as he had prayed before, and came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon. him) and saluted him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) returned the salutation and said: Go back and say prayer, for you have not offered the prayer. This (act of repeating the prayer) was done three times. Upon this the person said: By Him Who hast sent you with Truth, whatever better I can do than this, please teach me. He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you get up to pray, recite takbir, and then recite whatever you conveniently can from the Qur'an, then bow down and remain quietly in that position, then raise your- self and stand erect; then prostrate yourself and remain quietly in that attitude; then raise yourself and sit quietly; and do that throughout all your prayers","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":47},"chapter":{"id":11,"ara-name":"باب وُجُوبِ قِرَاءَةِ الْفَاتِحَةِ فِي كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ وَإِنَّهُ إِذَا لَمْ يُحْسِنِ الْفَاتِحَةَ وَلاَ أَمْكَنَهُ تَعَلُّمُهَا قَرَأَ مَا تَيَسَّرَ لَهُ مِنْ غَيْرِهَا","eng-name":"It Is Obligatory To Recite Al-Fatihah In Every Rak'ah; If A Person Cannot Recite Al-Fatihah Or Cannot Learn It, Then He Should Recite Whatever Else He Can Manage","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
