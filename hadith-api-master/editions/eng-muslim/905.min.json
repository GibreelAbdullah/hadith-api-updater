Abu Ishaq (a student of Imam Muslim) said: Abu Bakr the son of Abu Nadr's sister has (critically) discussed this hadith. Imam Muslim said: Whom can you find a more authentic transmitter of hadith than Sulaiman? Abu Bakr said to him (Imam Muslim): What about the hadith narrated by Abu Huraira, i.e. the hadith that when the Qur'an is recited (in prayer) observe silence? He (Abu Bakr again) said: Then, why have you not included it (in your compilation)? He (Imam Muslim) said: I have not included in this every hadith which I deem authentic; I have recorded only such ahadith on which there is an agreement (amongst the Muhaddithin apart from their being authentic)","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":67},"chapter":{"id":16,"ara-name":"باب التَّشَهُّدِ فِي الصَّلاَةِ ","eng-name":"The Tashah-hud In The Prayer","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
