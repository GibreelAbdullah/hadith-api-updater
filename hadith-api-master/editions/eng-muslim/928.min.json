And Abu Bakr was making audible to the people his takbir. As he paid his attention towards us he saw us standing and (directed us to sit down) with a gesture. So we sat down and said our prayer with his prayer in a sitting posture. After uttering salutation he said: You were at this time about to do an act like that of the Persians and the Romans. They stand before their kings while they sit, so don't do that; follow your Imams. If they say prayer standing, you should also do so, and if they say prayer sitting, you should also say prayer sitting","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":90},"chapter":{"id":19,"ara-name":"باب ائْتِمَامِ الْمَأْمُومِ بِالإِمَامِ ","eng-name":"Following The Imam","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
