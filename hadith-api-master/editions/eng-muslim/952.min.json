Shu'ba reported that he participated In the expedition of Tabuk along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out to answer the call of nature before the morning prayer. and I carried along with him a jar (full of water). When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came back to me (after relieving himself). I began to pour water upon his hands out of the jar and he washed his hands three times, then washed his face three times. He then tried to tuck up the sleeves of his cloak upon his forearms but since the sleeves were tight he inserted his hands in the cloak and then brought out his forearms up to the elbow below the cloak, and then wiped over his shoes and then moved on. Mughira said:I also moved along with him till he came to the people and (he found) that they had been saying their prayer under the Imamah of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) could get one rak ah out of two and said (this) last rak'ah along with the people. When Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf pronounced the salutation, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up to complete the prayer. This made the Muslims terrified and most of them began to recite the glory of the Lord. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer, he turned towards them and then said: You did well, or said with a sense of joy: You did the right thing that you said prayer at the appointed hour","grades":[{"name":"Imam Muslim","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":4,"hadith":114},"chapter":{"id":22,"ara-name":"باب تَقْدِيمِ الْجَمَاعَةِ مَنْ يُصَلِّي بِهِمْ إِذَا تَأَخَّرَ الإِمَامُ وَلَمْ يَخَافُوا مَفْسَدَةً بِالتَّقْدِيمِ","eng-name":"The Congregation Appointing Someone To Lead Them If The Imam Is Delayed And If There Is No Fear Of Negative Repercussions","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
