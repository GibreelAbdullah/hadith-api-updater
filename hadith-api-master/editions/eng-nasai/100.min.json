She rinsed her mouth, sniffed water into her nose and blew it out three times, and washed her face three times. Then she washed her right hand three times and her left hand three times. Then she put her hand on the front of her head and wiped her head once, front to back. Then she rubbed her ears with her hands, then she passed her hands over her cheeks.\" Salim said: \"I came to her as a slave with a contract of manumission, and she did not hide herself from me. She would sit before me and talk to me, until I came to her one day and said: 'Pray for blessing for me, O Mother of Believers.' She said: 'Why is that?' I said: 'Allah has set me free.' She said: 'May Allah bless you.' Then she lowered the Hijab before me, and I never saw her again after that day","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":100},"chapter":{"id":83,"ara-name":"باب مَسْحِ الْمَرْأَةِ رَأْسَهَا ","eng-name":"Women Wiping Their Heads","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
