By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk. The fasting person has two moments of joy: When he breaks his fast he rejoices at breaking his fast and when he meets his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, he will rejoice at having fasted","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":127},"chapter":{"id":42,"ara-name":"باب ذِكْرِ الاِخْتِلاَفِ عَلَى أَبِي صَالِحٍ فِي هَذَا الْحَدِيثِ","eng-name":"Mentioning the Different Reports from Abu Salih in this Narration","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
