Fasting is a shield. If any one of you is observing a fast, let him not utte obscene a fast, let him not utter obscene talk or raise his voice in anger, and if anyone insults him or wants to fight, let him say: I am a person who is fasting. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk.\" ' (Sahih) This Hadith was narrated from Abu Hurairah by Saeed bin Al-Musayyab","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":128},"chapter":{"id":42,"ara-name":"باب ذِكْرِ الاِخْتِلاَفِ عَلَى أَبِي صَالِحٍ فِي هَذَا الْحَدِيثِ","eng-name":"Mentioning the Different Reports from Abu Salih in this Narration","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
