She said: 'What a wonderful man he is. He does not sleep at night and he does not break his fast during the day.' He got upset with me and said: 'I got you married to a woman from among the Muslims and you have neglected her.' I did not pay attention to what he said because of my energy and love of worship. News of that reached the Prophet and he said: 'But I stand (in prayer) and I sleep, I fast and I break my fast. So stand (in prayer) and sleep, fast and break your fast.' He said: 'Fast three days of every month.' I said: 'I am able to do more than that.' He said: 'O bserve the fast of Dawud, peace be upon him: fast one day and break your fast one day.' I said: 'I am able to do more than that.' He said: 'Read the Quran (once) every month.' Then it ended up being every fifteen days, and I still said: 'I am able to do more than that.\"' 'Ata said: \"someone who heard him told me that Ibn 'Umar (said) that the Prophet said: 'Whoever fasts every day of his life, then he has not fasted","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih Isnaad"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":22,"hadith":301},"chapter":{"id":76,"ara-name":"باب صَوْمِ يَوْمٍ وَإِفْطَارِ يَوْمٍ وَذِكْرِ اخْتِلاَفِ أَلْفَاظِ النَّاقِلِينَ فِي ذَلِكَ لِخَبَرِ عَبْدِ","eng-name":"Fasting one day, and not fasting one day, and the difference in the wording of the transmitters Of The Narration Of 'Abdullah Bin 'Amr About It","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
