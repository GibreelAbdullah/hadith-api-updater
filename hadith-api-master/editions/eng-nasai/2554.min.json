Most of them, may all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The face of the Messenger of Allah changed when he saw them in poverty. He went in (to his house) then he came out and ordered Bilah to call the Adhan and then the Iqamah. He (the Prophet) prayed, tjem je addressed te,, (reciting the Verses): 'O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him(Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women: and fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual right), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is Ever and All-Watcher over you.' [1] and: 'Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow,' [2] Then they gave in charity, some giving a Dinar, others a Dirham, or a garment, or a Sa' of wheat or, a Sa' of dates, until he said: 'Even half a date.' A man from among the Ansar came with a bag of money which his hands could hardly lift. The people followed one another (in giving charity) until I saw two heaps of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah shining like gold (with joy). The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever sets a good precedent in Islam, he will have the reward for that, and the reward of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever sets an evil precedent in Islam, he will have a burden of sin for that, and the burden of those who acted in accordance with it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Muslim"}],"reference":{"book":23,"hadith":120},"chapter":{"id":64,"ara-name":"باب التَّحْرِيضِ عَلَى الصَّدَقَةِ ","eng-name":"Urging Charity","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
