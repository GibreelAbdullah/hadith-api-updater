They said:'O Messenger of Allah, we are nomads who follows the herds, not farmers and growers, and the climate of Al-Madinah does not suit us.' So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)told them to go out to a flock of female camels and drink their milk and urine.

News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he sent people after them.
