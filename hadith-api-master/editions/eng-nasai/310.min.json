The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stayed there looking for it and the people stayed with him. There was no water near them, and they did not have water with them. The people came to Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'Do you see what 'Aishah has done? She has made the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the people stop and they are not near any water and they do not have water with them.' Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, came while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was resting his head on my thigh and had gone to sleep. He said: 'You have detained the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and the people, and they are not near any water and they do not have any water with them.'\" 'Aishah said: \"Abu Bakr rebuked me and said whatever Allah willed he would say. He started poking me on my hip, and the only thing that prevented me from moving was the fact that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was resting on my thigh. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) slept until morning when he woke up without any water. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime revealed the verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said: 'This is not the first time we have been blessed because of you, O family of Abu Bakr!'\" She said: \"Then we made the camel that I had been riding stand up, and we found the necklace beneath it","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":311},"chapter":{"id":194,"ara-name":"باب بَدْءِ التَّيَمُّمِ","eng-name":"The Beginning Of Tayammum","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
