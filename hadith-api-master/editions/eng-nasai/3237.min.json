And the Messenger of Allah proposed that I marry his freed slave, Usamah bin Zaid. I was told that the Messenger of Allah had said: 'Whoever loves me, let him love Usamah.' When the Messenger of Allah spoke to me I said: 'My affairs are in your hands; marry me to whomever you wish.' He said: 'Go to Umm Sharik.'

He said: 'Do not do that, for Umm Sharik has a lot of guests, and I would not like your Khimar to fall off, or your shins to become uncovered, and the people to see something of you that you do not want them to see.
