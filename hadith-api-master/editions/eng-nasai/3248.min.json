I said: 'If you wish, I will marry you to Hafsah.' He said: 'I will think about it.' A few days passed, then I met him and he said: 'I do not want to get married at the moment.'\" 'Umar said: \"Then I met Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: 'If you wish, I will marry Hafsah to you.' He did not give me any answer, and I felt more upset with him than I had with 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him. Several days passed, then the Messenger of Allah proposed marriage to her, and I married her to him. Abu Bakr met me and said: 'Perhaps you felt upset with me when you offered Hafsah in marriage to me and I did not give you an answer?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you made the offer to me except the fact that I had heard the Messenger of Allah speak of her, and I did not want to disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah; if he had left her, then I would have married her","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":26,"hadith":53},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب عَرْضِ الرَّجُلِ ابْنَتَهُ عَلَى مَنْ يَرْضَى .","eng-name":"A Man Offering His Daughter In Marriage To Someone Whom He Likes","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
