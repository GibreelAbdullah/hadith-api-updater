A man among his Companions stood up and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, if you do not want to marry her, then marry me to her.\" He said: \"Do you have anything?\" He said: \"No, by Allah, I do not have anything.\" He said: \"Look, even if it is only an iron ring.\" He went, then he came back and said: \"No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (lower garment)\" - Sahl said: \"He did not have a Rida' (upper garment)\" - \"she can have half of it.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"What could she do with your Izar?
