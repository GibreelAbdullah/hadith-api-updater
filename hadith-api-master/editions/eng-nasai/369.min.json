Say: \"That is an Adha (a harmful thing).[2] So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded them to eat and drink with them (menstruating women) and to mix them in their houses, and to do everything with them except intercourse. The Jews said: 'The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) does not leave anything of our affairs except he goes against it.' Usaid bin Hudair and 'Abbad bin Bishr went and told the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they said: 'Should we have intercourse with them when they are menstruating?' The expression of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed greatly until we thought he was angry with them, and they left. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) received a gift of milk, so he sent someone to bring them back and he gave them some to drink, so we knew that he was not angry with them.\" [1] Al-Baqarah 2:222 [2] Al-Baqarah 2:","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":3,"hadith":21},"chapter":{"id":8,"ara-name":"باب مَا يُنَالُ مِنَ الْحَائِضِ وَتَأْوِيلِ قَوْلِ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ { وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَاعْتَزِلُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ } الآيَةَ","eng-name":"How To Interact With A Menstruating Woman And The Interpretation Of The Saying Of Allah: They Ask You Concerning Menstruation.
