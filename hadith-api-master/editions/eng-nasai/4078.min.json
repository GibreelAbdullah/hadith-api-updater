His companion said to him: 'Do not say Prophet; if he hears you, he will become big-headed.' So they came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and asked him about nine clear signs. He said to them: 'Do not associate anything with Allah, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not kill any soul whom Allah has forbidden you to kill, except by right, do not speak falsely about an innocent man before a ruler, do not engage in magic, do not consume Riba (usury), do not slander chaste women, and do not flee on the day of the march (to battle). And for you Jews especially, do not break the Sabbath.' They kissed his hands and feet and said: 'We bear witness that you are a Prophet.' He said: 'What is keeping you from following me?'
