I asked him about dogs and he said: 'If you release your dog and he catches (the game) but does not eat it, then eat, because his catching it is its slaughter. If you find another dog with your dog and you fear that it caught (the game) with him and killed it, then do not eat, for you said the name of Allah over your dog, but you did not say His name over the other one","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":42,"hadith":2},"chapter":{"id":2,"ara-name":"باب النَّهْىِ عَنْ أَكْلِ، مَا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ ","eng-name":"The Prohibition Of Eating That Over Which The Name Of Allah Has Not Been mentioned","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
