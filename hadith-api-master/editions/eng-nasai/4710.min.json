He came to the Jews and said: \"By Allah, you killed him. \" They said: \"By Allah, we did not kill him.\"Then he went back to the Messenger of Allah and told him about that. Then he and Huwayysah - his brother who was older than him - and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, came (to the Prophet). Muhayysah, who was the one who had been at Khaibar, began to speak, but the messenger of Allah said: \"Let the elder speak first,\" So Huwayysah elder speaks first.\" So Huwayysah spoke, then Muhayysah spoke. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Either (the Jews) will pay the Diyah for your comanion, or war will be declared on them.\" The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to that effect (to the Jews) and they wrote back saying: \"By Allah, we did not kill him.\" The Messenger of Allah said to Huwayysah.
