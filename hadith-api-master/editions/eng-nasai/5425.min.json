One of them came out with her hand bleeding and claimed that her companion had injured her, but the other one denied it. I wrote to Ibn 'Abbas concerning that. He wrote, (saying) that the Messenger of Allah [SAW] ruled that the person against whom the claim was made should swear an oath. For if people were to be given what they claimed was theirs, then people would make claims against the wealth and blood of others.\" So he called her and recited this Verse to her: \"Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter...\" until the end of the Verse. He called her and recited that to her, and she confessed to that.
