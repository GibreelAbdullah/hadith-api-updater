He was walking and holding hands with a young man of Quraish who was suspected of drinking Khamr. He said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah [SAW] say: Whoever drinks Khamr once, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does it again, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does it again, his repentance will not be accepted for 40 days, then if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does it again (a fourth time), then it is a right upon Allah to make him drink from the mud of Khibal on the Day of Resurrection.\" This is the wording of 'Amr","grades":[{"name":"Abu Ghuddah","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":51,"hadith":132},"chapter":{"id":45,"ara-name":"باب تَوْبَةِ شَارِبِ الْخَمْرِ ","eng-name":"Repentance of the One Who Has Drunk Khamr","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
