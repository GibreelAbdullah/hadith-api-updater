A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he does not oppress him, nor does he fail him, nor does he lie to him, nor does he hold him in contempt. Taqwa (piety) is right here [and he pointed to his chest three times]. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim is inviolable for another Muslim: his blood, his property, and his honour.” [Muslim]","grades":[],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":35},"chapter":{"id":null,"ara-name":null,"eng_name":null,"isFirstHadith":null}}]}
