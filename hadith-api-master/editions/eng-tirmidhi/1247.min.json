And if the separation referred to speech, and there was no option left for him after the sale, then this Hadith would be meaningless, since he (ﷺ) said: \"And it is not lawful for him to separate from his companion, fearing that he will change his mind","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":14,"hadith":47},"chapter":{"id":26,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي الْبَيِّعَيْنِ بِالْخِيَارِ مَا لَمْ يَتَفَرَّقَا","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About 'Both The Buyer And The Seller Retain The Option As Long As They Have Not Separated'","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
