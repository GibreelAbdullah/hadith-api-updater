And the meaning of his saying: \"I haven been prohibited from the Zabd (gifts) of the idolaters\" is their gifts. It has been reported about the Messenger (ﷺ) that he used to accept the gifts of the idolaters while a dislike for that is mentioned in this Hadith. And the implication is that this was after he used to accept from them, and then he later forbade their gifts","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":21,"hadith":38},"chapter":{"id":24,"ara-name":"باب فِي كَرَاهِيَةِ هَدَايَا الْمُشْرِكِينَ","eng-name":"About The Gifts Of The Idolaters Being Disliked","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
