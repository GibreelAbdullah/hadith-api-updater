So this is the most virtuous rank. And a slave whom Allah provides with knowledge, but He does not provide with wealth. So he has a truthful intent, saying: 'If I had wealth, then I would do the deeds of so-and-so with it.' He has his intention, so their rewards are the same. And a slave whom Allah provides with wealth, but He does not provide him with knowledge. [So he] spends his wealth rashly without knowledge, nor having Taqwa of his Lord, nor nurturing the ties of kinship, and he does not know that Allah has a right in it. So this is the most despicable rank. And a slave whom Allah does not provide with wealth nor knowledge, so he says: 'If I had wealth, then I would do the deeds of so-and-so with it.' He has his intention, so their sin is the same","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":36,"hadith":22},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ مَثَلُ الدُّنْيَا مَثَلُ أَرْبَعَةِ نَفَرٍ","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About 'The Parable Of Th World Is That Of Four People'","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
