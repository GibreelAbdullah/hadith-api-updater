Allah will say to him: 'I gave to you, I granted you, and I bestowed favors upon you. So what did you do?' So he says: 'I collected it, increased it, and left it as more than what it was. So return me and I shall give it all to You.' So He will say to him: 'Show me what you have prepared.' So he says: 'My Lord!
