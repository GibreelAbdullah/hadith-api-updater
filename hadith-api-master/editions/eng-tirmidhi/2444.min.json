Its cups are as numerous as the stars, whoever drinks one drink from it, he will never be thirsty after that again. The first people to arrive at it are the poor among the Muhajirin with disheveled heads, dirty clothes, those whom the women of favor would not marry, nor would the doors be open for them.'
