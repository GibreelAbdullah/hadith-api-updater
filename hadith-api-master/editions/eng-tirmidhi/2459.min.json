It has been related that 'Umar bin Al-Khattäb said: \"Reckon with yourselves before you are reckoned with, and prepare for the Greatest Inquisition. The reckoning of the Day of Judgement is only light for the one who reckoned with himself in the world.\" And, it has been related that Maimun bin Mihran said: \"The slave (of Allah) will not be a Taqi until he has reckoned himself, just as he would account for where his business partner got his food and clothing","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":45},"chapter":{"id":25,"ara-name":"باب ","eng-name":"The Hadith: The Clever Person is the One Who Subjects His Soul and Works for What is After Death","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
