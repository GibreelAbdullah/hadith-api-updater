I heard him saying: 'There was a man called Al-Kifl among the children of Isra'il who did not restrain himself from committing sins. A woman came to him and he gave her sixty Dinar so he could sleep with her. When he sat up from her, as a man sits up from a woman, she began to tremble and cry, so he said: \"Why are you crying, did I do something to harm you?\" She said: \"No. But it is because of what I did, I only did so out of need.\" He said: \"You did this without having done (it before), so leave me, and it (the money) is for you.\" And then he said: \"By Allah! I will never disobey Allah after that.\" He died during the night and morning came with: \" Indeed Allah has forgiven Al-Kifl\" written upon his door.\" Other chains report similar narrations","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":37,"hadith":82},"chapter":{"id":48,"ara-name":"باب ) )","eng-name":"In Which There are Four Ahadith","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
