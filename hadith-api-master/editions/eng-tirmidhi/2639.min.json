Ninety-nine scrolls will be laid out for him, each scroll is as far as the eye can see, then He will say: 'Do you deny any of this? Have those who recorded this wronged you?' He will say: 'No, O Lord!' He will say: Do you have an excuse?' He will say: 'No, O Lord!' So He will say: 'Rather you have a good deed with us, so you shall not be wronged today.\" Then He will bring out a card (Bitaqah); on it will be: \"I testify to La Ilaha Illallah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.\" He will say: 'Bring your scales.' He will say: 'O Lord! What good is this card next to these scrolls?' He will say: 'You shall not be wronged.' He said: 'The scrolls will be put on a pan (of the scale), and the card on (the other) pan: the scrolls will be light, and the card will be heavy, nothing is heavier than the Name of Allah","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih"}],"reference":{"book":40,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":17,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِيمَنْ يَمُوتُ وَهُوَ يَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About Whoever Dies While He Bears Witness To La Ilaha Illallah","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
