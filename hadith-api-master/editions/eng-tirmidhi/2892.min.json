Mughirah bin Muslim reported it from Abu Az-Zubair, from Jabir from the Prophet (ﷺ) and it is similar to this. Zuhair reported it and said: \"I said to Abu Az-Zubair: 'Did you hear Jabir mentioning this Hadith?' He said: 'Safwan or Ibn Safwan informed me of it.'\" It is as if Zuhair rejected the idea that this Hadith was from Abu Az-Zubair from Jabir. (Another chain) with similar in meaning. (Another chain) that Tawus said: \"They are seventy good merits more of virtue in it than every Surah in the Qur'an","grades":[{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Daif Maqtu"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Daif"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":18},"chapter":{"id":9,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي سُورَةِ الْمُلْكِ ","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About [The Virtue Of] Surat Al-Mulk","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
