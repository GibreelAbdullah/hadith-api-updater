Every time he was to recite a Surah for them during Salat, he would begin by reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad until he finished, then he would recite another Surah with it. He did that in each Rak'ah. His companions talked to him and said: 'You recite this Surah. You should either recite it or leave it and recite another Surah.'\" He said: \"I shall not leave it, if you would like me to lead you with it then I shall do so, and if you do not like it then I shall leave you.\" And they considered him the best among them, and they did not like the idea of someone else leading them. So when the Prophet (ﷺ) came to them they informed him about what had happened and he (ﷺ) said: \"O so-and-so! What prevents you from doing what your companions told you to do, why do recite this Surah in every Rak'ah\" He said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Indeed I love it.\" So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: \"Your love for it shall have you admitted into Paradise","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih Bukhari"}],"reference":{"book":45,"hadith":27},"chapter":{"id":11,"ara-name":"باب مَا جَاءَ فِي سُورَةِ الإِخْلاَصِ","eng-name":"What Has Been Related About Surat Al-Ikhlas","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
