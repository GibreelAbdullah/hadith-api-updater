So we sat with him. He had a stick with which he was scratching his head toward the heavens, and said: ‘There is not a single soul except that his place of entry has been decreed.’ The people said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Shall we not then rely upon what has been written upon us? For whoever is t be among the people of bliss, then he shall do that acts that lead to bliss, and whoever is to be among the people of misery, then he shall do the acts that lead to misery?’ He said: ‘Rather, do the deeds, for everyone is facilitated. As for the one who shall be among the people of bliss; then verily he is facilitated to do the acts that lead to bliss. And as for the one who shall be among the people of misery.’ Then he recited: As for him who has Taqwa, And believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the patch of ease. But he who is greedy and thinks himself sel-sufficient, and denies Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path to evil. And what will he wealth avail him when he goes down?”","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Bashar Awad Maarouf","grade":"Hasan Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Sahih - Agreed Upon"}],"reference":{"book":47,"hadith":396},"chapter":{"id":80,"ara-name":"باب وَمِنْ سُورَةِ وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى","eng-name":"Regarding Surat \"Wal-layl idha yaghsha\" (Surat Al-Layl)","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
