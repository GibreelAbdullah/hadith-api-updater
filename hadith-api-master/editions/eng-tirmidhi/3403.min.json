And this is more correct. [Abu `Eisa said:] And Zubair reported this hadith from Ishaq, from Farwah bin Nawfal, from his father from the Prophet (ﷺ), with similar wording. This is more appropriate and more correct than the narration of Shu`bah. The companions of Abu Ishaq were confused in the narration of this hadith. This hadith has been reported through routes other than this. `Abdur-Rahman is the brother of Farwah bin Nawfal","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":48,"hadith":34},"chapter":{"id":22,"ara-name":"باب مِنْهُ","eng-name":"Something Else: Concerning the Recitation of the Surat: Al-Karifun, As-Sajdah, Al-Mulk, Az-Zumar, Bani Isra’il, and Al-Musabbihat","isFirstHadith":true}}]}
