Then he would say: “O Allah, I ask You in this journey of mine from the righteousness and piety and actions that which you are pleased with. O Allah, ease for us the path, and make near for us the distance of the land. O Allah, You are the companion in the journey, and the caretaker for the family. O Allah, accompany us in our journey, and take care of our families (Allāhumma innī as’aluka fī safarī hādhā minal-birri wat-taqwā, wa minal-`amali mā tarḍā.
