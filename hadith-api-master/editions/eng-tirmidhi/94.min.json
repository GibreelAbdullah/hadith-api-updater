I asked him about that. He replied, 'I saw 'I saw Allah's Messenger performing Wudu and he wiped over his Khuff.' So I said to him, before Surah AI-Ma'idah (was revealed) or after AI-Ma'idah?' So he replied, 'I did not acceot Islam until after Al-Ma'idah.'\" Qutaibah narrated this to us; (saying) Khalid bin Ziyad At-Tirmidhi narrated it to us, from Muqatil bin Hayyan, from Shahr bin Hawshah, from Jarir. He said: Baqiyyah related it from Ibrahim bin Adham from Muqatil bin Hayyan, from Shahr bin Hawshah, from Jarir. This Hadith is explanatory, because some who dislike wiping over the Khuff give the interpretation that the Prophet's wiping over the two Khuff was before the revelation of Sural Al-Ma'idah. But in his Hadlth, Jarir mentions that he saw the Prophet wiping over his Khuff after the revelation of Surat Al-Ma'idah","grades":[{"name":"Ahmad Muhammad Shakir","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Al-Albani","grade":"Sahih"},{"name":"Zubair Ali Zai","grade":"Isnaad Hasan"}],"reference":{"book":1,"hadith":94},"chapter":{"id":70,"ara-name":"باب فِي الْمَسْحِ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ","eng-name":"[About] Wiping Over The Two Khuff","isFirstHadith":false}}]}
