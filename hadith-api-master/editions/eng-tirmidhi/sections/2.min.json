And this is the correct saying, and it is called At-Tathawwub as well, and this is the one chosen by the people of knowledge, and it is their opinion. It has been reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he would say: \"As-Salatu Khairum-minan-Nawm, (prayer is better than sleep)\" for Fajr. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said: \"I entered a Masjid with `Abdullah bin `Umar in which the Adhan was called, and we wanted to pray in it. Then the Mu'adh-dhin said the Tathwib.
